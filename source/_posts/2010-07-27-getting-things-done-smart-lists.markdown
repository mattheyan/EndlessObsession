### Smart Lists



In [my first gtd post](http://endlessobsession.com/2010/07/21/getting-things-done/), I described some of the strategies that I employ to help me get things done.  [Remember the Milk](http://rememberthemilk.com) has become a increasingly large part of that.  If you're reading this and you don't know about it, you should check it out!

Anyway, one thing that I discovered recently that has changed the way I use RTM is [smart lists](http://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/answers/smartlists/).  Seriously, I'm kicking myself for not knowing about this already!  Basically, smart lists are a way to save a search for later use, or, for the techies, a stored query.

This may not seem like a big deal, but for me it is HUGE.  This means that I can organize my tasks logically without having to worry about the different views that I might want to simulate.

To give you an idea of how this helps, here is my list of current smart lists (subject to change...a lot):



	
  * **_Big Projects_**:  Things that are going to take a long time.  These don't normally show up on my day-to-day activity.  It allows me to get an idea of high-level things that I'm working towards.  There also shouldn't be a lot of this due at the same time.

	
  * **_Blog_**:  Uses a "blog" tag so that I can track blogging stuff in separate logical lists (work, personal, etc...)

	
  * **_Important_**:  Priority 1 tasks from all lists.  This list should stay pretty sparse.

	
  * **_No Due_**:  Items that have not been assigned a due date are probably tentative or I may need to get rid of them.

	
  * **_No Estimate_**:  Since some of my lists take time estimates in to account, it pays for me to move tasks out of this list.

	
  * **_No Priority_**:  Much like no due, these tasks may need to be cleaned up.

	
  * **_Quick and Easy_**:  Time estimate is low.  This is ordered by due date, so I can use it to pick up easy tasks when I have a little time to spare.

	
  * **_This Week_**:  Everything that is due this week, except for today.

	
  * **_Today_**:  Self explanatory

	
  * **_Work Day_**:  This is the same as "Today", except filtered by an "am" tag that I use to indicate things that should be or can be done during the work day.  Walking the dog is not one of these, if I had a dog that is...



I have now switched to using the "Work Day" list only for "I Forgot the Milk" on my work computer.  This way, I don't have to mentally filter out tasks that I can't do until I get home.

I have yet to realize the full potential of smart lists, but I know that they will make things run a lot smoother for me.
