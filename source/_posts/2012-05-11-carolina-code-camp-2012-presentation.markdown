Recently I co-presented with [Bobby Dimmick](http://bobbydimmick.com/) at the annual [Carolina Code Camp](http://codecamp.developersguil1d.org/), put on by the Enterprise Developers Guild of Charlotte.  The event was wildly successful, with sold-out attendance and a day fully booked with speakers.

Our presentation was entitled "Building rich, model-centric, event-driven web apps using EF, Razor & open source".  The approach we took was to build a demo application from the ground up, and document the process so that it was reproducible.  The app is hosted at [todoapp.exosuite.com](http://todoapp.exosuite.com) and the walkthrough is at [todoapp.exosuite.com/walkthrough](http://todoapp.exosuite.com/walkthrough).

You can build the app yourself by following the walkthrough.  I promise, I did it many times!  :)
