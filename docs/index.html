application, you usually don’t have to access the file-system directly. One
reason that you would is to read a configuration file, but, .NET
configuration management handles this for you via ‘Web.config’ or ‘App.config’
and the <code>ConfigurationManager</code>. Another scenario is loading a resource, like an
image or document, from disk. But, again, the framework provides a nice solution
via embedded&nbsp;resources.</p>
<p>If you’re considering accessing the file-system you would do well to consider
if there are better ways to do what you’re trying to do. That being said, you
may occasionally have a legitimate reason to access the file-system&nbsp;directly.</p>
<p>Here are a few simple examples of how to do&nbsp;this:</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">ASP</span>.NET</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp"><span class="keyword">var</span> root = HttpContext.Current.Server.MapPath(<span class="string">"~/"</span>);</code></pre>
<p><strong>WinForms</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp"><span class="keyword">var</span> root = Application.ExecutablePath;</code></pre>
<p><strong><span class="caps">WPF</span>, Console Application,&nbsp;etc.</strong></p>
<pre><code class="language-csharp"><span class="keyword">var</span> assembly = System.Reflection.Assembly.GetEntryAssembly();
<span class="keyword">var</span> assemblyPath = <span class="keyword">new</span> Uri(assembly.CodeBase).AbsolutePath;
<span class="keyword">var</span> root = System.<span class="caps">IO</span>.Path.GetDirectoryName(assemblyPath);</code></pre>
<p>So, why would you even want to do&nbsp;this?</p>
<p><a rel="more" href="/blog/dotnet-project-root-at-runtime">Continue reading</a></p></section></article></section><section><article><header><h2 class="title"><a rel="article" href="/blog/removing-password-from-repo">Removing a Password from a Git Repository</a></h2><div class="byline"><span class="author">Bryan Matthews</span><time datetime="2016-05-30" pubdate>May 30th, 2016</time></div></header><section><p>It’s generally considered a bad idea to commit passwords, api keys, etc. to your
source code repository. There are various ways you can try to avoid this
(and you should), but sooner or later its going to happen. Someone will add some
“sensitive” data to a&nbsp;repository.</p>
<p>For some projects it doesn’t matter quite so much. If they’re not hosted
publicly on a site like github and never make it out of your company’s internal
network, then its not that big of a deal. For others, it is important, and it
could be that your only option is to reset the passwords, revoke the <span class="caps">API</span> keys,
or something to that effect. What a&nbsp;pain!</p>
<p>There is another option to consider if you’re using git. Since git allows you to
rewrite history, you can rewrite the repo to make it look like the password leak
never even happened. This should only be done if you know the data hasn’t been
leaked and the repo isn’t propogated all over your organization
(rewriting history will cause people grief if they have the repo&nbsp;already).</p>
<p>Let’s say your history looks something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code>c6 = add test cases
c5 = tweak theme colors
c4 = add password to config * &lt;- commit of the data leak
c3 = fix spelling error
c2 = prototype * &lt;- last commit to config before the data leak
c1 - add README

* = involves the offending file
</code></pre><p>Start by getting the last version of <strong>the config file</strong> before the password was
added to the config&nbsp;file.</p>
<p><code>git checkout c2 /path/to/config</code></p>
<p>…or, remove it&nbsp;manually.</p>
<p>Then, commit that&nbsp;change:</p>
<p><code>git commit -m &quot;remove password from config&quot;</code></p>
<p>Now your history looks like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code>c7 = remove password from config
c6 = add test cases
c5 = tweak theme colors
c4 = add password to config * &lt;- commit of the data leak
c3 = fix spelling error
c2 = prototype * &lt;- last commit to config before the data leak
c1 - add README

* = involves the offending file
</code></pre><p>Now, rebase the commit where the password was introduce (<code>c4</code> in this&nbsp;example):</p>
<p><code>git rebase c4~1 -i</code></p>
<p>This opens up vim, or whatever your configured editor&nbsp;is.</p>
<pre><code>pick c4 add password to config
pick c5 tweak theme colors
pick c6 add test cases
pick c7 remove password from config

A bunch of other stuff...
</code></pre><p>Move the “fix” commit (<code>c7</code> in our case) to the line <strong>below</strong> the one where the
password was <strong>added</strong> (<code>c4</code>), and change the prefix from ‘pick’ to&nbsp;‘fixup’.</p>
<pre><code>pick c4 add password to config
fixup c7 remove password from config
pick c5 tweak theme colors
pick c6 add test cases</code></pre><p>From <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-git-rebase/#commands-available-while-rebasing">github’s rebase documentation</a>,
this tells git to use this commit to “fix” the prior commit, and then discard&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>The result is that the history looks like it did before, but the password is no
longer in the config file on disk, or <em>in git’s history</em>. Also, if the only
change to that file in the offending commit was the password which you removed,
then the file will no longer show up in that commit (as you would&nbsp;expect).</p>

<p>Comments are probably one of the most boring topics you can&nbsp;imagine.</p>
<p>Plus, they’re so easy to&nbsp;write?</p>
<p>And yet, somehow I get the feeling we’re doing it&nbsp;wrong.</p>
<p>Have you ever tried in vain to understand why a bit of code was doing something
that made no sense, and wished that the author had left you a clue as to their
intentions at the time (in the comments,&nbsp;perhaps)?</p>
<p>Or, have you ever looked at a bit of code, and then the comments attached to it,
and then back at the code, and then the comments… and wondered, “Am I not
getting something about this code, or is this comment just plain wrong?” (Hint:
the comment is <em>probably</em>&nbsp;wrong.)</p>
<p>Finally, think back to the last time you looked at a comment and thought to yourself,
“hmm, that was actually&nbsp;useful”.</p>

while, and so I made the switch a few years ago in order to escape the clutches
of Wordpress. Now I have a hack-able blog that also costs me nothing to&nbsp;host.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Octopress isn’t a good long-term fit. At the end of the day the
deal-breaker for me is the fact that it runs on&nbsp;ruby.</p>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, ruby itself is just fine. But, if you’ve worked with ruby on
Windows you know that its full of pain all the way down. If you’re thinking
about it, do yourself a favor and just don’t do&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>Sure, I could have run Linux on a separate partition, or on a <span class="caps">VM</span>, or in the
cloud, etc. I have no problem doing that, except that it requires managing yet
another machine/OS. I’m already investing enough time automating Windows-based
workstations, so why <del>waste</del> spend my time on it if I don’t have&nbsp;to?</p>
<p>So I set out to find an alternative that would work reliably on Windows, and
<strong>run on node.js</strong>. I targeted node because it generally <em>just works</em> on Windows,
and node and JavaScript in general are skills that I’m more interested in developing.
What I found was <a href="https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith">Wintersmith</a>.</p>

<p>I discovered that the <span class="caps">YAML</span> that lives in each post’s header (more on that later) <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/1146">could include an “excerpt” property</a> where I could write my own summary of the&nbsp;post.</p>

<p>I hadn’t thought about it until now, but the configuration at the head of each post is <span class="caps">YAML</span>. I don’t know much about YAML, but apparently something was wrong with one of my&nbsp;excerpts.</p>
<p>Fortunately I was able to track it down to the “:” character, which is somehow significant in <span class="caps">YAML</span> syntax. <a href="http://yamllint.com/"><span class="caps">YAML</span> Lint</a> was an invaluable&nbsp;resource.</p>

<p>You might expect that after executing this code the text in the file would be “abc”.  Not quite.  In my case I was sometimes seeing results like&nbsp;this…</p>
<pre><code>abc

<p>It turns out that the <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.io.file.openwrite.aspx" title="System.IO.File.OpenWrite">documentation for File.OpenWrite</a> contains the&nbsp;answer.</p>

<p>If you overwrite a longer string (such as “This is a test of the OpenWrite method”) with a shorter string (such as “Second run”), the file will contain a mix of the strings (“Second runtest of the OpenWrite&nbsp;method”).</p>

<p><code>OpenWrite</code> behaves much like the dreaded insert mode in word processors and text&nbsp;editors.</p>

<p>I did some digging on the web and found a <a href="http://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=146745">chromium bug report</a>.</p>
<p>One of the comments near the end of the page gives the solution to the&nbsp;problem.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Actually that is the problem. Windows has a service called “Tablet <span class="caps">PC</span> Input Service”. When this is running Windows 7 thinks it’s a tablet instead of a desktop. Once I turned this off and restarted chrome the drop down spacing is correct. But as soon as I turn the service back on the extra spacing comes&nbsp;back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure enough, there was a service running on my laptop called “Tablet <span class="caps">PC</span> Input&nbsp;Service”.</p>
<p><img src="/images/tablet-pc-input-service.png" alt="Screenshot of excessive padding"></p>
<p>…and when I stopped the service _<strong>and restarted chrome</strong>_, the padding went back to&nbsp;normal.</p>
<p><img src="/images/select-nopad.png" alt="Screenshot of excessive padding"></p>
<p>My laptop is a touchscreen and turning off this service doesn’t seem to affect touchscreen functionality.  Don’t forget to change the service startup type to “Manual” or “Disabled” so that it doesn’t start back up the next time you log&nbsp;on.</p>

The following is my reaction and thoughts (hastily thrown together). Go to the link and read it first or what follows probably won’t make much&nbsp;sense.</p>
<p>I certainly agree that some of the practices he mention can have little benefit in the short term. Many people pointed out in the comments that the short term gains of “trimming the fat” can come back to haunt you on long term projects, and I’ll second&nbsp;that.</p>
<p>Someone in the comments described how they have frequently inherited projects where it looked like the developer(s) had this mindset and it usually turned out to be a mess/headache to maintain. I think the mental burden he described to understand concepts/tools like <span class="caps">IOC</span>, ORMs, etc. is only one side of the coin. The other side is that not following best practices and using powerful tools that are available can be just as frustrating to a developer who inherits the project (or even your future self), especially in the event that the app has to be significantly enhanced or changed. That said, I have also had the experience where I found that I had over-engineered a project too early and ended up “stuck” with some of those poor decisions later on. I think the key is to not try to over-engineer too early, but rather follow only tried and true best practices that require little added effort and could yield future gains, improve and refactor as the project grows, and never be satisfied with where things are today. For what it’s worth, in the case where I made regrettable engineering decisions early on, I was also deviating from common/best practices, i.e. trying to be&nbsp;clever.</p>
<p>As for F12, I don’t think you can ever really get around the limitations of the <span class="caps">IDE</span> with respect to interfaces and abstract/virtual members. I have been in the habit lately of using Shift+F12 (symbol search) rather than “Go to Definition” unless I know for sure that there is a single implementation of the member that I’m trying to get at. Resharper is also a good choice to improve the IDE experience. As irritating as F12 can be, I wouldn’t use that as reason to avoid using useful language&nbsp;features.</p>
<p>Finally, to tie it together with an anecdote: I can think of two projects off the top of my head that seem to fall into the too extremes. One was hastily thrown together by a freelance developer to meet a client need. The source control wasn’t hosted on a popular <span class="caps">OSS</span> hosting services, it was just offered up for download on the blog.  There were no unit tests.  Most of the code was in a single class file with a number of supporting classes that were essentially just data containers.  On the one hand, I ended up having to significantly enhance that project and found it to be very frustrating and painful.  On the other hand, if he hadn’t thrown it together it may be that nothing like it would have existed at all and I would have been forced to start from square 1 (and making my own mistakes as a result).  The other project was a highly engineered and conformed to a highly detailed open specification, complete with interfaces, IOC, and unit tests galore.  On the one hand, when I discovered a bug I was able to easily verify the bug via unit test, fix it, and see it go green.  On the other hand, the project is not very active now (has been somewhat superseded by other technology) so you could argue that the effort was&nbsp;wasted.</p>
<p>Its all about&nbsp;balance…</p>
<p>Also, someone pointed out that its possible to write tests as <span class="caps">UI</span> acceptance tests that actually interact with the web browser (using Selenium) and mimic user behavior. I happen to use WatiN instead in my day-to-day, but what’s important is that you can verify the behavior that your clients are going to be looking for in an automated fashion. Do&nbsp;it!</p>
<p>Thanks to Jonas for provoking critical thought!&nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Our presentation was entitled “Building rich, model-centric, event-driven web apps using <span class="caps">EF</span>, Razor <span class="amp">&amp;</span> open source”.  The approach we took was to build a demo application from the ground up, and document the process so that it was reproducible.
