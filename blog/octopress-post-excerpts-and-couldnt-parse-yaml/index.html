          <section><p>This evening I noticed a syntax error in my blog’s <span class="caps">ATOM</span> feed. The error seemed to stem from the text in one of my more recent posts, what exactly I didn’t bother to determine. However, I also noticed that the post summaries were rather large and didn’t appear to do a good job of summarizing post content in any case. So, it seemed the best thing to do was to figure out how I could get Octopress to use a better summary and kill 2 birds with one&nbsp;stone.</p>
<p>I discovered that the <span class="caps">YAML</span> that lives in each post’s header (more on that later) <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/1146">could include an “excerpt” property</a> where I could write my own summary of the&nbsp;post.</p>
<p>For example, here’s the header of this&nbsp;post:</p>

excerpt: This evening I noticed a syntax error in my blog&#39;s ATOM feed. The error seemed to stem from the text in one of my more recent posts, what exactly I didn&#39;t bother to determine. However, I also noticed that the post summaries were rather large and didn&#39;t appear to do a good job of summarizing post content in any case. So, it seemed the best thing to do was to figure out how I could get Octopress to use a better summary and kill 2 birds with one stone.

</code></pre><p>This worked so well that I promptly went through all of my posts and threw up some quick excerpts without much thought. Unfortunately I soon ran into an error: <a href="https://github.com/imathis/octopress/issues/57">‘parse’: couldn’t parse <span class="caps">YAML</span></a>.</p>
<p>I hadn’t thought about it until now, but the configuration at the head of each post is <span class="caps">YAML</span>. I don’t know much about YAML, but apparently something was wrong with one of my&nbsp;excerpts.</p>
<p>Fortunately I was able to track it down to the “:” character, which is somehow significant in <span class="caps">YAML</span> syntax. <a href="http://yamllint.com/"><span class="caps">YAML</span> Lint</a> was an invaluable&nbsp;resource.</p>
