            <section><p>Using the tf command line tool you can rollback all or part of a tfs checkin.  This is useful for two reasons: 1) If you at least want to roll back all changes in one or more file (not some changes in a file) then it saves you from having to manually revert changes (I’m a firm believer in not giving yourself the opportunity to goof up) , and 2) the checkin is actually marked as a <em>rollback</em>, so you don’t have to rely on checkin notes to identify it as&nbsp;such.</p>
<p>As a side note, based on what I’ve seen in the way that tfs represents changes, this rollback changeset is simply an add, edit or delete, with the additional information that it was a rollback of a prior change.  The original checkin is still in the tfs&nbsp;history.</p>
<p>To do a rollback, first open up the visual studio command prompt.  You should have a shortcut in your start menu.  On my machine the command is: <em><strong>%comspec% /k “”c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\<span class="caps">VC</span>\vcvarsall.bat”” x86</strong></em>.</p>
<p>Here’s the help for tf rollback (using the command <em>tf rollback /?</em>):</p>
<p><span class="caps">TF</span> - Team Foundation Version Control Tool, Version&nbsp;10.0.30319.1</p>
<p>Copyright (c) Microsoft Corporation.  All rights&nbsp;reserved.</p>
<p>Rolls back the changes in a single or a range of&nbsp;changesets:</p>
<p>tf rollback /changeset:changesetfrom~changesetto [itemspec]&nbsp;[/recursive]</p>
<pre><code>        [/lock:none|checkin|checkout] [/version:versionspec]




        [/keepmergehistory] [/noprompt] [/login:username,[password]]
</code></pre><p>tf rollback /toversion:versionspec itemspec&nbsp;[/recursive]</p>
<pre><code>        [/lock:none|checkin|checkout] [/version:versionspec]




        [/keepmergehistory] [/noprompt] [/login:username,[password]]
</code></pre><p>Versionspec:</p>
<pre><code>Date/Time         D&quot;any .Net Framework-supported format&quot;




                  or any of the date formats of the local machine




Changeset number  Cnnnnnn




Label             Llabelname




Latest version    T




Workspace         Wworkspacename;workspaceowner
</code></pre><p>First, we need to make sure we are working within our&nbsp;workspace.</p>
<p><strong><em>cd&nbsp;path\to\workspace\root</em></strong></p>
<p>So, for example, we could rollback an entire&nbsp;changeset:</p>
<p><strong><em>tf rollback&nbsp;/changeset:12345</em></strong></p>
<p>Or, we can rollback a single item in the&nbsp;changeset:</p>
<p><strong><em>tf rollback /changeset:12345&nbsp;$/Path/To/Item</em></strong></p>
<p>There is also a login param that you can pass if&nbsp;needed:</p>
<p><strong><em>tf rollback /changeset:12345&nbsp;/login:domain\username,password</em></strong></p>
<p>Enjoy!</p>

            <section><p>Here’s a neat visual studio tip.  You can run any external command from within visual studio, and add a button to the command bar or map it to a keyboard shortcut.  This is really important to me because I rely heavily on keyboard shortcuts.  I love that I can hit a combination of keys and perform a repetitive task automatically, plus the result can be incorporated into visual studio by way of the output&nbsp;window.</p>
<p>Some examples of what you might use this&nbsp;for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get latest on several team projects to start your&nbsp;day.</li>
<li>Check out a specific set of&nbsp;files.</li>
<li>Automate various git commands from within visual&nbsp;studio.</li>
<li>Run a batch file with a set of arguments that you define when you run&nbsp;it.</li>
<li>Launch another application (i.e.: web&nbsp;browser).</li>
</ul>
<p>What follows is inspired by Rob Conery’s Git series on tekpub.  You’ll have to watch the full video to see how he uses external tools to incorporate git in Visual&nbsp;Studio.</p>

              <div class="byline"><span class="author">Bryan Matthews</span>

            <section><p>As a follow up to my <a href="/blog/www.google.com">Brief Introduction to ExoWeb</a>, I would like to go into more detail about the communications between client and&nbsp;server.</p>
<p>The client interacts with the server in two basic&nbsp;ways.</p>
<ol>
<li>Pulling information: type and instance&nbsp;data.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Pushing information: changes to the model and/or instructions to do&nbsp;something.</li>
</ol>
<p>The first type, pulling information, is pretty straightforward. Type information doesn’t change (frequently) so it is actually cached on the client if possible. Querying for instance data is similar to querying a database. You request an object of a particular type with a particular id, but you can also include a set of paths that tell the services what additional related data you are interested in. The primary component of a query might look something like&nbsp;this.</p>
<pre><code>{ from: &quot;Person&quot;, id: &quot;1&quot;, and: [&quot;this.Additional.Properties.To.Load&quot;] }
</code></pre><p>The second type, pushing information, gets a little more interesting. If you’re going to sync data between two disconnected systems there are two primary approaches that you might take. First, you could send simple data from point A to point B, manipulate it, then send it back from point B to point A in the same form. As you could imagine this can get pretty expensive and tedious. Of course, you might just send the portions of data that have changed to cut down on overhead. The bigger problem, I think, is that you don’t really know what has happened unless you do full graph comparisons. Another approach is to keep track of <em>changes</em> as they occur and send those back and forth. This is what ExoWeb&nbsp;does.</p>
<pre><code>changes: [ { type: &quot;ValueChange&quot;, instance: { id: &quot;1&quot;, type: &quot;Person&quot; }, property: &quot;FirstName&quot;, oldValue: &quot;Rob&quot;, newValue: &quot;Robert&quot; }, ... } ]
</code></pre><p>The client can also raise events, for example “save”, a built-in event. In response, the server can send back additional changes to the&nbsp;model.</p>
<pre><code>changes: [ { type: &quot;Save&quot;, idChanges: [ { type: &quot;Person&quot;, from: &quot;?4&quot;, to: &quot;644&quot; } ] }, ... ]
</code></pre><p>The payload isn’t limited to data. It can also include conditions, for example, permissions, or invalid data conditions. More on that&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>This has been a very basic introduction to the way client-server communication works in ExoWeb. Look out for more updates in the&nbsp;future.</p>

That post was a little vague because not much has been documented about what you can actually do with ExoWeb.  That’s what I hope to do&nbsp;here.</p>
<p>First off, let me restate the purpose of ExoWeb as simply as I can.  ExoWeb exists to bridge the gap between the client and server.  You can think of it as a combination client-server mapper and model-view&nbsp;mapper.</p>

Recently I’ve been dabbling in ruby and have used <a href="http://rvm.beginrescueend.com/"><span class="caps">RVM</span></a> to manage ruby environments and gems.

            <section><p>One of my coworkers, Matt Hooper, recently released an open source project called Amnesia.  The aim of Amnesia is to “transacts all changes to a website to facilitate automated <span class="caps">UI</span> testing”.  Basically, you can run your tests and change and add data all day long and the changes, whether they come from the website or the tests themselves, will not last beyond the scope of the test.  Pretty cool,&nbsp;huh?</p>

            </header>
            <section><p>Off and on at <a href="http://vc3.com/">work</a> over the last year or so I have been working on an open-source project called <a href="http://exoweb.codeplex.com/">ExoWeb</a>, as well as supporting projects called <a href="http://exograph.codeplex.com/">ExoGraph</a> and ExoRule.  ExoWeb and ExoGraph are hosted on <a href="http://codeplex.com/">Codeplex</a>, though they are somewhat stale at this&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>Before I go any farther I’ll give you (and future self) my take on the purpose of these&nbsp;projects.</p>
<h3 id="exograph">ExoGraph</h3>
<p>…is essentially an&nbsp;enabler.</p>
<p>From the codeplex&nbsp;site:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>ExoGraph is a graph library that leverages type information to optimize graph operations and notifications. The library exposes type-level events for object initialization, property retrieval, property path changes, and custom domain events within a graph&nbsp;context.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This doesn’t sound very useful in and of itself, right?  Well, it’s not supposed to be.  It’s an enabler, remember?  That’s where ExoWeb and ExoRule come&nbsp;in…</p>
<h3 id="exorule">ExoRule</h3>
<p>…is a rules framework that leverages ExoGraph.  That is all for&nbsp;now.</p>
<h3 id="exoweb">ExoWeb</h3>
<p>…is a JavaScript framework, basically.  It also relies on a supporting server-side web request handler as well as a working ExoGraph&nbsp;implementation.</p>
<p>From the codeplex site,&nbsp;ExoWeb…</p>
<blockquote>
<p>…aims to provide a rich JavaScript object model, intuitive <span class="caps">UI</span> code based on the fundamental languages of the web (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript), model- and UI-driven validation, and seamless synchronization of changes between client and&nbsp;server.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That may not be crystal-clear, but fortunately you can browse the source, which is what I really want to write about&nbsp;anyway.</p>
<p>The JavaScript source is now <a href="http://github.com/mattheyan/exoweb">hosted on Github</a>.  If you take a look at the <a href="http://exoweb.codeplex.com/SourceControl/list/changesets">source on Codeplex</a> you’ll notice that there are 8 script files: exoweb.js, exoweb.model.js, exoweb.mapper.js, exoweb.view.js, exoweb.ui.js, exoweb.mock.js, exoweb.jquery.js, and start.debug.js.  The source on Github, however, has many more script files as well as specs (using jasmine) and a build process (using rake) that produces the scripts listed above.  It is loosely modeled after the <a href="http://github.com/jquery/jquery">jquery source</a>.</p>
<p>I have a few goals in hosting the project on&nbsp;Github.</p>
<ol>
<li>Isolate classes and related functions in order to make it easier to manage, illuminate code structure, improve architecture and design, and limit&nbsp;dependencies.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Allow for (hopefully) isolated testing of individual classes and&nbsp;functions.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Isolate the bulk of the code which is not dependent on any particular JavaScript library or server-side&nbsp;technology.</li>
</ol>
<ol>
<li>Take advantage of github’s popularity in open source software collaboration, and…well, I just like&nbsp;Github.</li>
</ol>
<p>At the time of this writing the project produces the destination scripts that more or less match the scripts in the original project (not the ones on codeplex, they’re old).  Also, a few of the source files have corresponding specs that pass, using <a href="http://nodejs.org/">nodejs</a> to run&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Finally, in writing the build script, I got the chance to learn a little <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">rake</a> (ruby make), which I highly&nbsp;recommend.</p>
<p>One of my other goals is to create working ExoGraph/ExoWeb implementations for django and rails.  The beginnings of the django implementation is currently <a href="http://github.com/mattheyan/django-exoweb">hosted on Github</a> as&nbsp;well.</p>

              </div>
            </header>
            <section><p>First, a disclaimer:  you may not find this post useful unless you are interested in virtualbox or virtualization.  Also, there are plenty of other blogs that will tell you how to install the guest additions.  This is my personal&nbsp;reference.</p>
<p>According to the <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox">virtualbox wiki</a>, virtualbox is <em>the only professional-quality virtualization solution that is also Open Source Software</em>.  Alright, a big +1 for open source!  Not that I have ever cracked open the source…&nbsp;:P</p>
<p>Another big plus for me is that it is cross-platform.  I use windows and linux machines, so this is very important to&nbsp;me.</p>
<p><em>As an aside, VMware player appears to also be somewhat cross-platform (windows and linux, no <span class="caps">OSX</span>).  I have used it as well, but I feel better about my experience with virtualbox.  However, I don’t have any real solid reasons to explain why.  Feel free to try to change my mind if you&nbsp;must…</em></p>
<p>So what are the guest additions?  From the <a href="http://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/VirtualBox">wiki</a>, it is <em>special software that can be installed inside Windows, Linux and Solaris virtual machines to improve performance and make integration much more seamless</em>.  Things like <em>mouse pointer integration and arbitrary screen solutions (e.g. by resizing the guest window)</em>.  That’s the kicker for me.  I install them in my linux guests so that the guest resolution will adjust to match the host&nbsp;window.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point of this is how to actually install them.  <a href="http://digitizor.com/2009/05/26/how-to-install-virtualbox-guest-additions-for-a-linux-guest/">Here is a link</a> to a good set of instructions in case you don’t find these&nbsp;sufficient.</p>
<p>First, mount the guest additions “disc” from the host window’s menu:  Devices &gt; Install Guest&nbsp;Additions.</p>
<p><img src="http://endlessobsession.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/09/install_guest_additions-300x185.png" alt="Mount Guest Additions Menu"></p>
<p>Now you should see the disc mounted in nautilus.  The next step is to copy the appropriate file to your home folder (or some other location on the guest&nbsp;machine).</p>
<ul>
<li>cp /media//VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run&nbsp;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, make the file&nbsp;runnable.</p>
<ul>
<li>sudo chmod +x&nbsp;VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, run the&nbsp;installer.</p>
<ul>
<li>sudo&nbsp;./VBoxLinuxAdditions-x86.run</li>
</ul>
<p>That’s&nbsp;all!</p>

            <section><p>If you ever need to resize and reposition a jQuery dialog, the following script should do the&nbsp;trick:</p>
<ul>
<li>function setDialogSize($dialogEl, width, height)&nbsp;{</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>$dialogEl.dialog(“option”, “width”,&nbsp;width);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>$dialogEl.dialog(“option”, “height”,&nbsp;height);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>$dialogEl.dialog(“option”, “position”, $dialogEl.dialog(“option”,&nbsp;“position”));</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>}</li>
</ul>
<p>If you change a <span class="caps">UI</span> component’s option it should respond by updating immediately to reflect the change.  If it doesn’t, it’s a bug.  I read that somewhere&nbsp;:)</p>
