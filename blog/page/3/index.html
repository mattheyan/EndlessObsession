            <section><p>I received a wonderful error from Internet Explorer today:  “Unknown runtime&nbsp;error”.</p>
<p>It seemed to be an Internet Explorer issue only, since it worked fine in other browsers.  I was able to track this down to where the innerHTML for an element was being&nbsp;set.</p>
<p>I found out <a href="http://piecesofrakesh.blogspot.com/2007/02/ies-unknown-runtime-error-when-using.html">here</a> that the problem was because my <span class="caps">HTML</span> was invalid.  As the poster notes, IE is actually enforcing <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/text.html#h-9.3.1">the spec</a>, which is good.  However, the error message is completely worthless, which is not good.  Sadly, this is what I expect from&nbsp;<span class="caps">IE</span>.</p>
<p>In his example, he was attempting to inject an “li” into a “p”, which is obviously invalid.  He noted that <span class="caps">IE</span>’s behavior seemed to be inconsistent, since it was ok with an “ul”.  However, in my case I found that injecting an “ul” into a “p” caused the same problem.  This may have been changed recently, a la Windows&nbsp;Update…</p>

            <section><h3 id="smart-lists">Smart&nbsp;Lists</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://endlessobsession.com/2010/07/21/getting-things-done/">my first gtd post</a>, I described some of the strategies that I employ to help me get things done.  <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">Remember the Milk</a> has become a increasingly large part of that.  If you’re reading this and you don’t know about it, you should check it&nbsp;out!</p>
<p>Anyway, one thing that I discovered recently that has changed the way I use <span class="caps">RTM</span> is <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/answers/smartlists/">smart lists</a>.  Seriously, I’m kicking myself for not knowing about this already!  Basically, smart lists are a way to save a search for later use, or, for the techies, a stored&nbsp;query.</p>
<p>This may not seem like a big deal, but for me it is <span class="caps">HUGE</span>.  This means that I can organize my tasks logically without having to worry about the different views that I might want to&nbsp;simulate.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how this helps, here is my list of current smart lists (subject to change…a&nbsp;lot):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Big Projects</em></strong>:  Things that are going to take a long time.  These don’t normally show up on my day-to-day activity.  It allows me to get an idea of high-level things that I’m working towards.  There also shouldn’t be a lot of this due at the same&nbsp;time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Blog</em></strong>:  Uses a “blog” tag so that I can track blogging stuff in separate logical lists (work, personal,&nbsp;etc…)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Important</em></strong>:  Priority 1 tasks from all lists.  This list should stay pretty&nbsp;sparse.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>No Due</em></strong>:  Items that have not been assigned a due date are probably tentative or I may need to get rid of&nbsp;them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>No Estimate</em></strong>:  Since some of my lists take time estimates in to account, it pays for me to move tasks out of this&nbsp;list.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>No Priority</em></strong>:  Much like no due, these tasks may need to be cleaned&nbsp;up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Quick and Easy</em></strong>:  Time estimate is low.  This is ordered by due date, so I can use it to pick up easy tasks when I have a little time to&nbsp;spare.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>This Week</em></strong>:  Everything that is due this week, except for&nbsp;today.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Today</em></strong>:  Self&nbsp;explanatory</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Work Day</em></strong>:  This is the same as “Today”, except filtered by an “am” tag that I use to indicate things that should be or can be done during the work day.  Walking the dog is not one of these, if I had a dog that&nbsp;is…</li>
</ul>
<p>I have now switched to using the “Work Day” list only for “I Forgot the Milk” on my work computer.  This way, I don’t have to mentally filter out tasks that I can’t do until I get&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>I have yet to realize the full potential of smart lists, but I know that they will make things run a lot smoother for&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a table that contains records with a foreign key (string, int, guid, etc…) and an index or sequence number, 1-3, so that there are three records for each foreign key value.  In another table you have any number of records that contain the same foreign key, as well as a value field (date, number, string, etc…) that can be sequenced in some logical fashion corresponding to the sequence 1-3 in the key table.  You mission (should you choose to accept it) is to get the values from the value table and join them to the corresponding sequence records in the key&nbsp;table.</p>
<p>What follows is the answer I arrived at late this afternoon.  Please let me know if you have a better&nbsp;way.</p>

<p>I union the key table 3 times, filtering by each sequence number.  In each sub-query, the value is obtained by selecting the top N values, filtered by the foreign key and ordered by their value (descending), and then getting the min&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>Kind of an odd-ball case, but I might find this humorous one day.  And Pete will laugh, because I laughed at my&nbsp;code.</p>

                <time datetime="2010-07-21" pubdate>Jul 21st, 2010</time>
              </div>
            </header>
            <section><p>Lately I’ve become somewhat obsessed with getting things done.  I wasn’t always this way, I swear!  In my younger days I was as disorganized and lazy as anyone.  And I procrastinated sometimes (understatement of the&nbsp;year).</p>
<p>For me, getting things done has to be more than a state of mind or goal, it has to be a <strong>system</strong> and a <strong>habit</strong>.  I didn’t come to this conclusion all at once.  It happened gradually, and I’m always trying to be better.  The system looks something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Always</em></strong> write things down (requires discipline <span class="amp">&amp;</span>&nbsp;habit)</li>
<li>Make sure its in your face or readily&nbsp;available</li>
<li>Use a check list system to provide positive&nbsp;reinforcement</li>
<li>Figure out how everything works together and stick with&nbsp;it</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="i-think-i-was-supposed-to-do-something-">I think I was supposed to do&nbsp;something…</h3>
<p>It started with the realization that I can be <strong><em>extremely</em></strong> forgetful.  At least, I think thats how it started…  So, the natural response to this realization was to start writing down <span class="caps">EVERYTHING</span>, with the understanding that if it isn’t written down I won’t remember it and, therefore, there is <strong><em>zero</em></strong> chance that it will be done.  That’s a little extreme, but sometimes it helps to think about things in terms of the worst-case scenario.  I started out using <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5321180/turn-gmail-into-your-ultimate-gtd-inbox">GMail</a>, Google tasks, Google calendar, and, eventually, <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">remember the milk</a>.</p>
<p>I’m going to jump ahead of myself and talk about ways to make sure you always write things down.  In the beginning I would write things on sheets of paper and even on my hand and arm at times.  This is convenient, but its not the most reliable system.  I use <span class="caps">RTM</span> pretty heavily at this point, so it gets a lot of my attention when it comes to&nbsp;efficiency.</p>
<p>The first thing I did was make sure that <span class="caps">RTM</span> could be launched as a desktop app using the shortcut launching software of my choice (<a href="http://www.launchy.net/">launchy</a>).  I accomplished this using <a href="http://prism.mozillalabs.com/">Prism</a>, which allows you to use firefox to convert a website into a desktop application.  This is important to me for two reason:  isolation and convenience.  First, a website like <span class="caps">RTM</span> is different than most in that I don’t need to be connected to the rest of the web and I don’t need to arrive there from anywhere else.  In essence, it is less like a traditional website and more like a standalone application.  Second, I would like to be able to have RTM open and close in the blink of an eye.  Currently I can type Win+Space (to open launchy), then rtm (or any other query that finds my prism app), then Enter, and remember the milk is open pretty much immediately.  Then, thanks to RTM keyboard shortcuts, I can type in a new task (or do pretty much anything else) and my hands never have to leave the keyboard!  If I could get Vimium to play nice with RTM things would be even&nbsp;better!</p>
<p>What I have been looking at more recently is the ability to add a task <strong><em>directly from launchy</em></strong>.  What makes this possible is the fact that remember the milk supports <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/answers/sending/emailinbox.rtm">adding tasks via email</a>.  There was a solution for this that <a href="http://lifehacker.com/284127/take-launchy-beyond-application-launching">uses twitter</a>, but I have heard that it isn’t very reliable.  I would rather not go back to writing notes on my hand and hoping that I don’t need to wash them.  More recently there have been a couple of solutions that make use of the email <span class="caps">API</span> instead (<a href="http://lifehacker.com/5197116/remember-the-milk-for-launchy-adds-tasks-in-a-flash">lifehacker</a> and <a href="http://sheenonline.biz/2008/07/remember-the-milk-posting-directly-from-your-desktop/">sheenonline</a>).  I’m currently using a modified version of the second option, which I will try to finish up and post&nbsp;soon.</p>
<p>Because of all of this, most basic task management can be accomplished with very little impact on my normal&nbsp;workflow.</p>
<h3 id="break-the-procrastination-habit">Break the Procrastination&nbsp;Habit</h3>
<p>Well, that’s great progress, but its not the end of the story.  The second realization was that if I write things down I won’t forget them, but that doesn’t mean I’ll actually do them.  I’m still lazy and I like to procrastinate.  I had defeated forgetfulness, now I set out on a glorious crusade against the forces of procrastination.  My first order of businesses was to make sure that the “things” were always before me, which would (in theory) increase the odds that they actually “get&nbsp;done”.</p>
<p>I started out by <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/gmail/">adding <span class="caps">RTM</span> to my GMail inbox</a> (the gadget, not the browser add-on) and my <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/services/googlecalendar/">Google calendar</a>.  Of course, this is only useful as long as I’m using GMail or my calendar.  Since I use windows 7 at work, I installed the “<a href="http://gallery.live.com/liveItemDetail.aspx?li=55ccf415-af76-4a33-bad6-5bdaa370b214">I Forgot the Milk</a>“ desktop gadget, which gives you basically the same view as the GMail gadget.  With the <a href="http://nes.bplaced.net/sidebar7.html">windows 7 sidebar gadget</a>, I can be sure that my tasks are <strong><em>always visible</em></strong> on my desktop.  There is also a handy little app that allows you to run the same interface as a <a href="http://www.adobe.com/cfusion/marketplace/index.cfm?event=marketplace.offering&amp;offeringid=10052&amp;marketplaceid=1">desktop app</a>, but I don’t have any use for it&nbsp;currently.</p>
<h3 id="the-task-list">The Task&nbsp;List</h3>
<p>Now that I’m using <span class="caps">RTM</span>, I need to figure out how to use its many feature effectively.  Here is a collection of notes about how I use RTM.  I will modify this as I refine the&nbsp;process.</p>
<h4 id="list">List</h4>
<p>I started out with only a couple of lists, but the number has grown.  The reason for this is that more lists means fewer tasks in each list, which means less tasks that I never see (and forget about) because they extend beyond the browser window.  Logical grouping is the main factor when deciding on lists, but a low task count is a close&nbsp;second.</p>
<h4 id="priorities">Priorities</h4>
<p>The tasks in <span class="caps">RTM</span> can be assigned a priority of 1-3 (or none).  This is useful because it determines the order of tasks in RTM and related apps.  I have bounced around between only assigning priorities to some tasks, then assigning to all tasks, then back to only some.  Recently I have started using the following rule-of-thumb to assigning priorities, rather than arbitrary choices.  I must resist the urge to make everything priority 1&nbsp;:)</p>
<ol>
<li>High Priority:  These tasks absolutely have to be done.  You don’t want to
forget about them, and your life will be adversely affected if you fail to
complete.  If there is a due date assigned, it is probably not an optional
due date (ex:  pay rent, schedule dentist&nbsp;appointment).</li>
<li>Medium Priority:  These tasks are also important, but life will go on if they
are not done.  If a due date is assigned it should be done by then, but is
probably somewhat flexible (ex:  important phone call, write blog&nbsp;post).</li>
<li>Low Priority:  These are less important tasks that don’t necessarily have to
be done, but you have decided that you want to, as time permits.  These
usually won’t have due dates, except in the case that it is something that
happens at a certain date/time but is still optional, or something that you
do at a regular interval (ex:  watch world cup final, clean bathroom&nbsp;sink).</li>
<li>No Priority:  These are tasks that are things that you <strong><em>might </em></strong>want to
do, but haven’t decided the if or&nbsp;when.</li>
</ol>
<h4 id="due-date">Due&nbsp;Date</h4>
<p>I have been in the habit of assigning due dates to tasks and then postponing them repeatedly.  Kind of&nbsp;depressing…</p>
<p>There are two ways that I use due date:  when something is due (really), and when I <strong><em>want</em></strong> to do something.  Differentiating between the two is something that I have not been able to figure out (suggestions welcome).  Because of the way that I use gadgets I think I am pretty much tied to using due date for both <strong><em>real</em></strong> due dates and <strong><em>pseudo</em></strong> due&nbsp;dates.</p>
<h4 id="repeat">Repeat</h4>
<p>I use this field to set things like daily, weekly, and monthly chores.  Pretty&nbsp;intuitive.</p>
<h4 id="so-far-i-have-not-used-most-of-the-other-fields-since-they-do-not-affect-my-workflow-">So far I have not used most of the other fields since they do not affect my&nbsp;workflow.</h4>
<h3 id="what-s-next-">What’s&nbsp;Next?</h3>
<p>For a while now I have been using <span class="caps">RTM</span> almost exclusively.  This has worked pretty well so far, but is not perfect.  The next step is to figure out how GMail, Remember the Milk, and Google Calendar can work&nbsp;together.</p>

            <section><p>I recently encountered an exception with a message that looked something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<p>There was an error deserializing the object of type Foo.  No set method for property ‘’ in type&nbsp;‘’.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>This was coming out of WriteObject (or a similar method) of DataContractSerializer (or DataContractJsonSerializer, or some other&nbsp;flavor).</p>
<p>If you see this error, don’t be thrown off by the bizarre error message.  If my experience holds true this error is in fact caused by a read-only property.  Unfortunately, the error message won’t give you any clues to what the property is, and the offending type is probably <span class="caps">NOT</span> the type Foo, as the error message&nbsp;suggests.</p>
<p>Description of my&nbsp;scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempt to serialize an object with a property that is a list of <span class="caps">WCF</span> serializable objects (base&nbsp;type).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The last item in the list is a sub type, “Foo”, that contains a property <span class="caps">WITHOUT</span> a setter. Serialization is&nbsp;ok.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After the item of type “Foo”, another item of type “Bar” (a different sub type) is added. This type does <span class="caps">NOT</span> have any properties without a setter. Attempting to serialize the parent object now fails with message “There was an error deserializing the object of type Bar, My Assembly. No set method for property ‘’ in type&nbsp;‘’.”</li>
</ul>
<p>See this <a href="https://connect.microsoft.com/wcf/feedback/details/525090/wcf-serialization-error-message-does-not-specify-type-and-method?wa=wsignin1.0#tabs">ticket</a> and this <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1731572/error-using-wcf-and-datacontractserializer">stackoverflow post</a> (author describes a slightly different scenario) for more&nbsp;information.</p>
<p>Good luck!&nbsp;:)</p>

<p>Edit 2010-07-01:  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3118898/c-extension-method-on-type-with-generic-type-argument/3159532#3159532">question&nbsp;answered</a></p>
<p>This is going to be a short post, and I’ll get right to the&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>I’m looking at ways to improve the consistency, brevity, and readability of some code in the application I’m working on.  The starting code looked something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">context.GetGraphType&lt;Bar&gt;().Subscribe&lt;Fizz&gt;(
  (instance, evt) =&gt; e.Execute((Bar)instance.Instance)
);
</code></pre>
<p>It breaks down like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get some&nbsp;type</li>
<li>Subscribe to an&nbsp;event</li>
<li>When the event happens, do&nbsp;something</li>
</ul>
<p>It just so happens that we have all followed an unspoken convention: an Execute method with a single parameter that is of the type that is subscribing to the event (Bar).  You can imagine that once you have over a dozen of these subscriptions it can start to look a little silly.  More on that&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to rewrite it to look something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs"><span class="keyword">typeof</span>(Bar).SubscribeTo&lt;Fizz&gt;(context);
</code></pre>
<p>My hope was that it now reads something like “bar subscribes to the fizz event on the given context”, rather than “the context gets the bar type and subscribes to fizz and then does some stuff.”  Hopefully I’m not totally off base here.  I did check with a co-worker and he confirmed my&nbsp;thoughts.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish the above I wanted to make use of an abstract generic base class for the events, something&nbsp;like:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs">public abstract class Event&lt;T&gt;
{
    public abstract void Execute(T arg);
}
</code></pre>
<p>In the example, T is Bar - the type that subscribes to the event.  I implemented the SubscribeTo method as a local extension method.  Unfortunately, I got stuck when I tried to set up a generic type parameter that would be of type Bar.  Something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<pre><code class="lang-cs"><span class="keyword">public</span> <span class="keyword">static</span> <span class="keyword">void</span> SubscribeTo&lt;TEvent&gt;(<span class="keyword">this</span> Type type, Context context)
    <span class="keyword">where</span> TEvent : Event&lt;the <span class="keyword">value</span> of parameter <span class="number">1</span>&gt;
{
    <span class="comment">// do stuff...</span>
}
</code></pre>
<p>If this were possible, one would be able to implement the change I proposed with type checking.  The compiler would verify that Fizz was a subclass of Event<Bar> and the extension method could treat it as&nbsp;such.</p>
<p>Do you know of a way to implement what I have proposed, or an alternative that is very&nbsp;similar?</p>
<p>Back to the convention I mentioned earlier.  In the spirit of utilizing conventions, I ended up using reflection to take advantage of it.  It isn’t checked by the compiler, but we have the next best thing.  The code runs on application start-up and the Execute method is retrieved when the event is subscribed to, not raised.  So, it will fail very early if there is a&nbsp;problem.</p>

            <section><p><em>Originally posted May 3&nbsp;2010</em></p>
<p>Recently I spent some time looking at generating a stack trace in JavaScript for the purpose of error reporting.  There are plenty of <a href="http://eriwen.com/javascript/stacktrace-update/">existing</a> <a href="http://helephant.com/2007/05/diy-javascript-stack-trace/">projects</a> out there that solve this problem, so I wouldn’t recommend rolling your&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>As a result of this I came across some odd behavior in JavaScript.  The code I was working with takes advantage of the special “arguments” variable (the “array” of arguments passed to the current function), which has a special “callee” property (the function that was called), which also has a special “caller” property (the function that called this function).  You can probably see how this would be tempting if you’re trying to construct a stack trace.  Unfortunately, this information is attached to the function object rather than some sort of “function invocation” object.  There are at least two cases where this makes constructing an accurate stack trace&nbsp;impossible.</p>
<ol>
<li>Function recursively calls itself.<ul>
<li>Since the caller property is attached to the function itself there is no
way of knowing (through this information alone) how many times the function was&nbsp;called.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Function A calls function B, which then calls function A…<ul>
<li>Even if there are terminating condition, the code that attempts to
reconstruct the stack trace (using “callee” and “caller”) will not
terminate.  There is a good description of this behavior
<a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Function/caller">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I was primarily interested in scenario 2, since this can cause errors.  To get around this you can detect that you have already encountered a given function and simply stop.  Of course this means that you lose any information that follows, but at least you won’t hang the&nbsp;browser.</p>
<p>Conclusion:  always check <span class="caps">MDC</span>&nbsp;:)</p>

              <div class="byline"><span class="author">Bryan Matthews</span>
                <time datetime="2010-06-11" pubdate>Jun 11th, 2010</time>

            <section><p><em>Originally posted April 7&nbsp;2010</em></p>
<p>Ok, I’ll start this post off with some background.  A couple of years ago I wrote a <span class="caps">SOAP</span> web service that manages printing for multiple users through a web application.  Sounds familiar, right?  Anyway, the client that interacts with the web service uses the Microsoft AJAX JavaScript framework (version 1).  The web service is hosted on a different server and domain.  However, since this is an internal application with a small number of users they were content to enable cross-domain data access and be done with&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago one of my coworkers was revisiting the client portion, which just happened to be upgraded to the <a href="http://ajax.codeplex.com/">beta version of the <span class="caps">AJAX</span> JavaScript framework</a>.  He started to see a syntax error, which I determined was occurring when handling the web service response.  I knew that the client framework supported <span class="caps">JSONP</span> in some form, and I also noticed an interesting “jsonp” query string argument in the web service call.  Believe it or not, the client was trying to use JSONP, even though the web service response was XML!  This obviously would result in a syntax error when trying to&nbsp;deserialize.</p>
<p>After looking over the JavaScript code I determined that the WebServiceProxy was using <span class="caps">JSONP</span> if either the protocol or host of the request was different than the current page.  I now know in hindsight that the documentation (at least in code) of WebServiceProxy.invoke clearly states this.  Luckily, the “enableJsonp” parameter can be set to <em>false</em> to override this&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>So, the bottom line is:  if you’re accessing a web service across domains and you don’t want to use <span class="caps">JSONP</span>, you have to set the  “enableJsonp” argument to <em>false</em>.  Here’s the method signature and&nbsp;documentation…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript">WebServiceProxy.invoke(servicePath, methodName, useGet, params, onSuccess, onFailure, userContext, timeout, enableJsonp, jsonpCallbackParameter) {
    <span class="comment">/// &lt;summary locid="M:J#Sys.Net.WebServiceProxy.invoke"&gt;&lt;/summary&gt;</span>
    <span class="comment">/// &lt;param name="servicePath" type="String"&gt;Path to the webservice&lt;/param&gt;</span>
    <span class="comment">/// &lt;param name="methodName" type="String" mayBeNull="true" optional="true"&gt;Method to invoke&lt;/param&gt;</span>
    <span class="comment">/// &lt;param name="useGet" type="Boolean" optional="true" mayBeNull="true"&gt;Controls whether requests use HttpGet&lt;/param&gt;</span>
    <span class="comment">/// &lt;param name="params" mayBeNull="true" optional="true"&gt;Method args.&lt;/param&gt;</span>
    <span class="comment">/// &lt;param name="onSuccess" type="Function" mayBeNull="true" optional="true"&gt;Success callback&lt;/param&gt;</span>
    <span class="comment">/// &lt;param name="onFailure" type="Function" mayBeNull="true" optional="true"&gt;Failure callback&lt;/param&gt;</span>
    <span class="comment">/// &lt;param name="userContext" mayBeNull="true" optional="true"&gt;Success callback&lt;/param&gt;</span>
    <span class="comment">/// &lt;param name="timeout" type="Number" optional="true" mayBeNull="true"&gt;Timeout in milliseconds&lt;/param&gt;</span>
    <span class="comment">/// &lt;param name="enableJsonp" type="Boolean" optional="true" mayBeNull="true"&gt;Whether to use <span class="caps">JSONP</span> if the servicePath is for a different domain (default is true).&lt;/param&gt;</span>
    <span class="comment">/// &lt;param name="jsonpCallbackParameter" type="String" optional="true" mayBeNull="true"&gt;The name of the callback parameter for <span class="caps">JSONP</span> request (default is callback).&lt;/param&gt;</span>
    <span class="comment">/// &lt;returns type="Sys.Net.WebRequest" mayBeNull="true"&gt;Returns the request that was sent (null for <span class="caps">JSONP</span> requests).&lt;/returns&gt;</span>

            <section><p>I’m making heavy use of Microsoft <span class="caps">AJAX</span> right now at work.  No, not the webforms controls, the <a href="http://asp.net/ajax/">JavaScript library</a>.  That’ s a little better,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the nice little features in <span class="caps">MS</span> AJAX is the ability to invoke a web service, passing in some arbitrary JavaScript object(s), and it just works!  Well, mostly of the time anyway.  Today I found out that you have to be careful with dates.  When I called a web service in this manner, and the object was a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Date">Date</a> or contained a Date, the deserialized DateTime object on the server was off by several&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p>At this point you’re probably thinking, “I know what the problem is, you idiot!  It’s local time!”  Hopefully you’re more polite than that, but you would be right, of course.  Since <a href="http://www.json.org/"><span class="caps">JSON</span> doesn’t account for dates</a>, we’re forced to improvise.  Check out <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bleroy/archive/2008/01/18/dates-and-json.aspx">this link</a> for a discussion of the <span class="caps">JSON</span> date format that the AJAX team decided on using.  You’ll notice that he mentions several time that the string format represents a <strong><span class="caps">UTC</span></strong> date <span class="amp">&amp;</span> time.  In my own defense, I simply provided a Date object and the rest was supposed to be magic (as we developers are so fond of saying).  After all, the Date object does include <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTimezoneOffset">time zone information</a>.  Unfortunately, the serialization code doesn’t take that into&nbsp;account.</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="built_in">Date</span>.isInstanceOfType(object)) {
    stringBuilder.append(<span class="string">'"\\/Date('</span>).
    append(object.getTime()).
    append(<span class="string">')\\/"'</span>);
    <span class="keyword">break</span>;
}
</code></pre>
<p>Since the date was going to be converted to a string anyway I went ahead and did the conversion ahead of time.  Something like&nbsp;this…</p>
<pre><code class="lang-javascript"><span class="keyword">var</span> offset = obj.getTimezoneOffset() * <span class="number">100</span> / <span class="number">60</span>;
<span class="keyword">var</span> offsetText = offset &gt;= <span class="number">1000</span> ? offset.toPrecision(<span class="number">4</span>) : <span class="string">"0"</span> +
offset.toPrecision(<span class="number">3</span>);
<span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="string">"/Date("</span> + (+obj).toString() + <span class="string">"-"</span> + offsetText + <span class="string">")/"</span>;
</code></pre>
<p>There are, of course, other ways to do this.  You could convert the date to a <span class="caps">UTC</span> date and let the serialization code do its thing.  This was my first solution, but I scrapped it in favor of the code above since it’s more consistent with how the dates were formatted when sent from the server.  You could also parse out the offset from the date string with a regex, but that just didn’t feel&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>Moral of the story:  either make sure your dates are <span class="caps">UTC</span> or serialize with the offset yourself.  I could think of cases where both would be inconvenient or impractical.  Hopefully you don’t have to face that&nbsp;problem.</p>
