          <section><h3 id="smart-lists">Smart&nbsp;Lists</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://endlessobsession.com/2010/07/21/getting-things-done/">my first gtd post</a>, I described some of the strategies that I employ to help me get things done.  <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">Remember the Milk</a> has become a increasingly large part of that.  If you’re reading this and you don’t know about it, you should check it&nbsp;out!</p>
<p>Anyway, one thing that I discovered recently that has changed the way I use <span class="caps">RTM</span> is <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/answers/smartlists/">smart lists</a>.  Seriously, I’m kicking myself for not knowing about this already!  Basically, smart lists are a way to save a search for later use, or, for the techies, a stored&nbsp;query.</p>
<p>This may not seem like a big deal, but for me it is <span class="caps">HUGE</span>.  This means that I can organize my tasks logically without having to worry about the different views that I might want to&nbsp;simulate.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how this helps, here is my list of current smart lists (subject to change…a&nbsp;lot):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Big Projects</em></strong>:  Things that are going to take a long time.  These don’t normally show up on my day-to-day activity.  It allows me to get an idea of high-level things that I’m working towards.  There also shouldn’t be a lot of this due at the same&nbsp;time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Blog</em></strong>:  Uses a “blog” tag so that I can track blogging stuff in separate logical lists (work, personal,&nbsp;etc…)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Important</em></strong>:  Priority 1 tasks from all lists.  This list should stay pretty&nbsp;sparse.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>No Due</em></strong>:  Items that have not been assigned a due date are probably tentative or I may need to get rid of&nbsp;them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>No Estimate</em></strong>:  Since some of my lists take time estimates in to account, it pays for me to move tasks out of this&nbsp;list.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>No Priority</em></strong>:  Much like no due, these tasks may need to be cleaned&nbsp;up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Quick and Easy</em></strong>:  Time estimate is low.  This is ordered by due date, so I can use it to pick up easy tasks when I have a little time to&nbsp;spare.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>This Week</em></strong>:  Everything that is due this week, except for&nbsp;today.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Today</em></strong>:  Self&nbsp;explanatory</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Work Day</em></strong>:  This is the same as “Today”, except filtered by an “am” tag that I use to indicate things that should be or can be done during the work day.  Walking the dog is not one of these, if I had a dog that&nbsp;is…</li>
</ul>
<p>I have now switched to using the “Work Day” list only for “I Forgot the Milk” on my work computer.  This way, I don’t have to mentally filter out tasks that I can’t do until I get&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>I have yet to realize the full potential of smart lists, but I know that they will make things run a lot smoother for&nbsp;me.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a table that contains records with a foreign key (string, int, guid, etc…) and an index or sequence number, 1-3, so that there are three records for each foreign key value.  In another table you have any number of records that contain the same foreign key, as well as a value field (date, number, string, etc…) that can be sequenced in some logical fashion corresponding to the sequence 1-3 in the key table.  You mission (should you choose to accept it) is to get the values from the value table and join them to the corresponding sequence records in the key&nbsp;table.</p>
<p>What follows is the answer I arrived at late this afternoon.  Please let me know if you have a better&nbsp;way.</p>
<ul>
<li>declare @dates table(num varchar(9), date&nbsp;datetime)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li></li>
<li><p>insert into&nbsp;@dates</p>
</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>select ‘192837465’, cast(‘1/3/2008’ as datetime)&nbsp;union</li>

<li>select ‘192837465’,&nbsp;3</li>

<li>date = (select <span class="caps">MIN</span>(t.date) from (select top 1 date from @dates where num = k.num order by date desc)&nbsp;t)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>from @keys&nbsp;k</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>where sequence =&nbsp;1</li>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>from @keys&nbsp;k</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>where sequence =&nbsp;3</li>
</ul>
<p>I union the key table 3 times, filtering by each sequence number.  In each sub-query, the value is obtained by selecting the top N values, filtered by the foreign key and ordered by their value (descending), and then getting the min&nbsp;value.</p>
<p>Kind of an odd-ball case, but I might find this humorous one day.  And Pete will laugh, because I laughed at my&nbsp;code.</p>

          <section><p>Lately I’ve become somewhat obsessed with getting things done.  I wasn’t always this way, I swear!  In my younger days I was as disorganized and lazy as anyone.  And I procrastinated sometimes (understatement of the&nbsp;year).</p>
<p>For me, getting things done has to be more than a state of mind or goal, it has to be a <strong>system</strong> and a <strong>habit</strong>.  I didn’t come to this conclusion all at once.  It happened gradually, and I’m always trying to be better.  The system looks something like&nbsp;this:</p>

          <section><p>I recently encountered an exception with a message that looked something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<p>There was an error deserializing the object of type Foo.  No set method for property ‘’ in type&nbsp;‘’.</p>
<p>Huh?</p>
<p>This was coming out of WriteObject (or a similar method) of DataContractSerializer (or DataContractJsonSerializer, or some other&nbsp;flavor).</p>
<p>If you see this error, don’t be thrown off by the bizarre error message.  If my experience holds true this error is in fact caused by a read-only property.  Unfortunately, the error message won’t give you any clues to what the property is, and the offending type is probably <span class="caps">NOT</span> the type Foo, as the error message&nbsp;suggests.</p>
<p>Description of my&nbsp;scenario:</p>
<ul>
<li>Attempt to serialize an object with a property that is a list of <span class="caps">WCF</span> serializable objects (base&nbsp;type).</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The last item in the list is a sub type, “Foo”, that contains a property <span class="caps">WITHOUT</span> a setter. Serialization is&nbsp;ok.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>After the item of type “Foo”, another item of type “Bar” (a different sub type) is added. This type does <span class="caps">NOT</span> have any properties without a setter. Attempting to serialize the parent object now fails with message “There was an error deserializing the object of type Bar, My Assembly. No set method for property ‘’ in type&nbsp;‘’.”</li>
</ul>

<p>Edit 2010-07-01:  <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3118898/c-extension-method-on-type-with-generic-type-argument/3159532#3159532">question&nbsp;answered</a></p>
<p>This is going to be a short post, and I’ll get right to the&nbsp;point.</p>
<p>I’m looking at ways to improve the consistency, brevity, and readability of some code in the application I’m working on.  The starting code looked something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>context.GetGraphType<Bar>().Subscribe<Fizz>(</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>(instance, evt) =&gt;&nbsp;e.Execute((Bar)instance.Instance)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>);</li>
</ul>
<p>It breaks down like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Get some&nbsp;type</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Subscribe to an&nbsp;event</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>When the event happens, do&nbsp;something</li>
</ul>
<p>It just so happens that we have all followed an unspoken convention: an Execute method with a single parameter that is of the type that is subscribing to the event (Bar).  You can imagine that once you have over a dozen of these subscriptions it can start to look a little silly.  More on that&nbsp;later.</p>
<p>So, I wanted to rewrite it to look something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>typeof(Bar).SubscribeTo<Fizz>(context);</li>
</ul>
<p>My hope was that it now reads something like “bar subscribes to the fizz event on the given context”, rather than “the context gets the bar type and subscribes to fizz and then does some stuff.”  Hopefully I’m not totally off base here.  I did check with a co-worker and he confirmed my&nbsp;thoughts.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish the above I wanted to make use of an abstract generic base class for the events, something&nbsp;like:</p>
<ul>
<li>public abstract class Event<T></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>{</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>public abstract void Execute(T&nbsp;arg);</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>}</li>
</ul>
<p>In the example, T is Bar - the type that subscribes to the event.  I implemented the SubscribeTo method as a local extension method.  Unfortunately, I got stuck when I tried to set up a generic type parameter that would be of type Bar.  Something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<ul>
<li>public static void SubscribeTo<TEvent>(this Type type, Context&nbsp;context)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>where TEvent : Event<the value of parameter 1></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>{</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>// do&nbsp;stuff…</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>}</li>
</ul>
<p>If this were possible, one would be able to implement the change I proposed with type checking.  The compiler would verify that Fizz was a subclass of Event<Bar> and the extension method could treat it as&nbsp;such.</p>
<p>Do you know of a way to implement what I have proposed, or an alternative that is very&nbsp;similar?</p>
<p>Back to the convention I mentioned earlier.  In the spirit of utilizing conventions, I ended up using reflection to take advantage of it.  It isn’t checked by the compiler, but we have the next best thing.  The code runs on application start-up and the Execute method is retrieved when the event is subscribed to, not raised.  So, it will fail very early if there is a&nbsp;problem.</p>

          <section><p><em>Originally posted May 3&nbsp;2010</em></p>
<p>Recently I spent some time looking at generating a stack trace in JavaScript for the purpose of error reporting.  There are plenty of <a href="http://eriwen.com/javascript/stacktrace-update/">existing</a> <a href="http://helephant.com/2007/05/diy-javascript-stack-trace/">projects</a> out there that solve this problem, so I wouldn’t recommend rolling your&nbsp;own.</p>
<p>As a result of this I came across some odd behavior in JavaScript.  The code I was working with takes advantage of the special “arguments” variable (the “array” of arguments passed to the current function), which has a special “callee” property (the function that was called), which also has a special “caller” property (the function that called this function).  You can probably see how this would be tempting if you’re trying to construct a stack trace.  Unfortunately, this information is attached to the function object rather than some sort of “function invocation” object.  There are at least two cases where this makes constructing an accurate stack trace&nbsp;impossible.</p>
<ol>
<li>Function recursively calls&nbsp;itself.</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>* Since the caller property is attached to the function itself there is no way of knowing (through this information alone) how many times the function was called.
</code></pre><ol>
<li>Function A calls function B, which then calls function&nbsp;A…</li>
</ol>
<pre><code>* Even if there are terminating condition, the code that attempts to reconstruct the stack trace (using &quot;callee&quot; and &quot;caller&quot;) will not terminate.  There is a good description of this behavior [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Function/caller).
</code></pre><p>I was primarily interested in scenario 2, since this can cause errors.  To get around this you can detect that you have already encountered a given function and simply stop.  Of course this means that you lose any information that follows, but at least you won’t hang the&nbsp;browser.</p>
<p>Conclusion:  always check <span class="caps">MDC</span>&nbsp;:)</p>

          </header>
          <section><p><em>Originally posted April 7&nbsp;2010</em></p>
<p>Ok, I’ll start this post off with some background.  A couple of years ago I wrote a <span class="caps">SOAP</span> web service that manages printing for multiple users through a web application.  Sounds familiar, right?  Anyway, the client that interacts with the web service uses the Microsoft AJAX JavaScript framework (version 1).  The web service is hosted on a different server and domain.  However, since this is an internal application with a small number of users they were content to enable cross-domain data access and be done with&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>A few weeks ago one of my coworkers was revisiting the client portion, which just happened to be upgraded to the <a href="http://ajax.codeplex.com/">beta version of the <span class="caps">AJAX</span> JavaScript framework</a>.  He started to see a syntax error, which I determined was occurring when handling the web service response.  I knew that the client framework supported <span class="caps">JSONP</span> in some form, and I also noticed an interesting “jsonp” query string argument in the web service call.  Believe it or not, the client was trying to use JSONP, even though the web service response was XML!  This obviously would result in a syntax error when trying to&nbsp;deserialize.</p>
<p>After looking over the JavaScript code I determined that the WebServiceProxy was using <span class="caps">JSONP</span> if either the protocol or host of the request was different than the current page.  I now know in hindsight that the documentation (at least in code) of WebServiceProxy.invoke clearly states this.  Luckily, the “enableJsonp” parameter can be set to <em>false</em> to override this&nbsp;behavior.</p>
<p>So, the bottom line is:  if you’re accessing a web service across domains and you don’t want to use <span class="caps">JSONP</span>, you have to set the  “enableJsonp” argument to <em>false</em>.  Here’s the method signature and&nbsp;documentation…</p>
<p>WebServiceProxy.invoke(servicePath, methodName, useGet, params, onSuccess, onFailure, userContext, timeout, enableJsonp, jsonpCallbackParameter)&nbsp;{</p>
<p>/// <summary locid="M:J#Sys.Net.WebServiceProxy.invoke"></summary></p>

            <h2><a rel="article" href="/blog/ms-ajax-and-json-date-serialization">MS AJAX and JSON Date Serialization</a></h2>
          </header>
          <section><p>I’m making heavy use of Microsoft <span class="caps">AJAX</span> right now at work.  No, not the webforms controls, the <a href="http://asp.net/ajax/">JavaScript library</a>.  That’ s a little better,&nbsp;right?</p>
<p>Anyway, one of the nice little features in <span class="caps">MS</span> AJAX is the ability to invoke a web service, passing in some arbitrary JavaScript object(s), and it just works!  Well, mostly of the time anyway.  Today I found out that you have to be careful with dates.  When I called a web service in this manner, and the object was a <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Date">Date</a> or contained a Date, the deserialized DateTime object on the server was off by several&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p>At this point you’re probably thinking, “I know what the problem is, you idiot!  It’s local time!”  Hopefully you’re more polite than that, but you would be right, of course.  Since <a href="http://www.json.org/"><span class="caps">JSON</span> doesn’t account for dates</a>, we’re forced to improvise.  Check out <a href="http://weblogs.asp.net/bleroy/archive/2008/01/18/dates-and-json.aspx">this link</a> for a discussion of the <span class="caps">JSON</span> date format that the AJAX team decided on using.  You’ll notice that he mentions several time that the string format represents a <strong><span class="caps">UTC</span></strong> date <span class="amp">&amp;</span> time.  In my own defense, I simply provided a Date object and the rest was supposed to be magic (as we developers are so fond of saying).  After all, the Date object does include <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/Core_JavaScript_1.5_Reference/Global_Objects/Date/getTimezoneOffset">time zone information</a>.  Unfortunately, the serialization code doesn’t take that into&nbsp;account.</p>
<p>if (Date.isInstanceOfType(object)) {
stringBuilder.append(‘“\/Date(‘).
append(object.getTime()).
append(‘)\/“‘);
break;&nbsp;}</p>
<p>Since the date was going to be converted to a string anyway I went ahead and did the conversion ahead of time.  Something like&nbsp;this…</p>
<p>var offset = obj.getTimezoneOffset() * 100 / 60;
var offsetText = offset &gt;= 1000 ? offset.toPrecision(4) : “0” +
offset.toPrecision(3);
return “/Date(“ + (+obj).toString() + “-“ + offsetText +&nbsp;“)/“;</p>
<p>There are, of course, other ways to do this.  You could convert the date to a <span class="caps">UTC</span> date and let the serialization code do its thing.  This was my first solution, but I scrapped it in favor of the code above since it’s more consistent with how the dates were formatted when sent from the server.  You could also parse out the offset from the date string with a regex, but that just didn’t feel&nbsp;right.</p>
<p>Moral of the story:  either make sure your dates are <span class="caps">UTC</span> or serialize with the offset yourself.  I could think of cases where both would be inconvenient or impractical.  Hopefully you don’t have to face that&nbsp;problem.</p>

          </header>
          <section><p>In hindsight this should have been a lot&nbsp;easier…</p>
<p>If you’re not familiar with <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/">tinymce</a> you should go <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/examples/full.php">check it out</a>.  Its a solid rich text editor for the web, which can be easily initialized and manipulated via JavaScript.  And best of all, <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/download.php">its free</a>!</p>
<p>Today I ran into a problem with the spell checking feature.  I’ll go ahead and state up front:  this was <strong><span class="caps">NOT</span></strong> a problem with tinymce.  This was my own doing.  It seemed that, although the spell checker was able to report misspellings in the editor, when you clicked on a misspelled word the highlighting would disappear and no context menu was shown.&nbsp;Strange…</p>
<p>First off, tinymce’s source code can be downloaded from <a href="http://tinymce.moxiecode.com/download.php">their site</a> (see “Deveopment package”), which made debugging <strong><em>really</em></strong> easy.  I noticed while inspecting the page using <a href="http://getfirebug.com/">firebug</a> that when I triggered spell checking the misspelled word(s) in the editor were wrapped in a span with a special class name.  I tracked down the spot in the code where the text was wrapped happened, and more importantly unwrapped, and then set breakpoints so that I could intercept when this was happening.  I found that it was ultimately being called from a “mousedown” event, which was in turn creating a new undo operation in the editor and firing the editor’s custom “change”&nbsp;event.</p>
<p>This took me back a few month to when I was integrating the editor into the website.  We basically use the editor to replace text areas on the page, which I gather is the norm.  Believe it or not, tinymce is kind enough to keep the original text area up to date as you make changes.  Unfortunately it doesn’t seem to fire the native browser events that we needed to detect that these changes were occurring.  The editor has its own <a href="http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/Editor">events</a>, some which mimic native browser&nbsp;events.</p>
<p>One in particular that I was interested in was the “<a href="http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:API/tinymce.Editor/onChange">onChange</a>“ event.  The documentation states that the event is raised “<em>when contents inside the editor gets changed</em>.”  If you look at the event handler arguments (Parameters) you’ll see that it makes mention of “undo levels” and “undo managers”.  As I understand it, the event actually fires when an “undo level” is added, some atomic action that can be reverted.  This explains why changes were being picked up at seemingly arbitrary times while editing the&nbsp;text.</p>
<p>Anyway, what does any of this have to do with the spell checking results disappearing?  Well, it turns out there were a couple of factors at work here.  The first I have already hinted at.  We were watching for “change” events on the editor and reacting accordingly.  These change events were also firing when you click inside of the editor, which is something that you would obviously do if you were trying to fix a typo to get rid of that nasty red underlining.  I presume this is because when the user has clicked, the text that they have typed can be viewed as an atomic action.  This can be slightly confusing if you don’t know what to expect, but it does make some sense in that it follows Microsoft Word behavior (a worthy goal for a rich text&nbsp;editor).</p>
<p>At any rate, the second factor was even more tricky.  The behavior that depends on knowing when the editor changes  (the reason we’re subscribing to the onChange event in the first place) also has to know what the current value is.  It is essentially a property change eventing mechanism.  This is all well and good, except that I was getting the editor’s value through the editor object’s <a href="http://wiki.moxiecode.com/index.php/TinyMCE:API/tinymce.Editor/getContent">getContent</a> method, without so much as skimming the documentation for it (it seemed pretty straightforward).  The documentation states that the function will “<em>cleanup the content before it gets returned using the different cleanup rules options</em>.”</p>
<p>If you think about it for a minute, you can see why this is a problem.  The editor’s content is essentially going to be the html that is displayed, right?  So, if the function is going to return the editor’s content, then it seems reasonable for it to “<em>cleanup the content</em>“ first.  And what would cleaning up the content involve?  That’s right!  It removes the html that wraps the text to signify that a word is misspelled.  After all, we wouldn’t want to store that in the&nbsp;database.</p>
<p>So at this point I’ve determined what the problem is.  Luckily, it doesn’t appear that I need to call the getContent method after all.  The original text area’s value is updated anyway, so I just read the value directly from the text area.  Problem solved!  Now I can go&nbsp;home…</p>

          </header>
          <section><p><em>Originally posted June 8&nbsp;2010</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Update 3/6/2015</strong></em>: The iTextSharp project’s license changed to be more restrictive, so it may not be practical for you to use it. Scroll to the bottom to see an alternative solution using&nbsp;PdfSharp.  </p>
<p>As you might have guessed from the title, this post is of the “get it done” variety.  So, the code may be a little rough.  Its the sort of code that works, but isn’t fully understood (by me at least).  I wasn’t able to find a clear example on the net, so I pieced together examples and guesses based on reading the code and interpreting method and class&nbsp;names.</p>
<p>Why guess?  Well, <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/itextsharp/">iTextSharp</a> is a pretty robust open source project which is useful for creating and manipulating <span class="caps">PDF</span> documents.  The problem is, it doesn’t seem to have any useful documentation online.  It <strong><em>is</em></strong> open source, so you can read the code all day.  Also, there are some tutorials that you can download from the <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/itextsharp/files/">files page</a> (in the examples&nbsp;folder).</p>
<p>The goal was to have a <span class="caps">PDF</span> document print automatically from a web page.  I decided to pass on coming up with a cross-browser (read: works in IE) method for automatically printing the document on the client, and instead decided to insert JavaScript into the generated PDF document that would cause it to print when opened.  This is what I came up&nbsp;with.</p>
<pre><code>PdfReader reader = new PdfReader(inputStreamOrFile);
int pageCount = reader.NumberOfPages;
Rectangle pageSize = reader.GetPageSize(1);

// Setup writer
PdfDocument document = new PdfDocument(pageSize);
PdfWriter writer = PdfWriter.GetInstance(document, outputStreamOrFile);

document.Open();

// Copy each page
PdfContentByte content = writer.DirectContent;
for (int i = 0; i &lt; pageCount; i++)
{
    document.NewPage();

    PdfImportedPage page = writer.GetImportedPage(reader, i + 1); // page numbers are one-based

    content.AddTemplate(page, 0, 0); // x and y correspond to position on the page?
}

// Insert JavaScript to print the document after a fraction of a second (allow time to become visible).
string jsText = &quot;var res = app.setTimeOut(&#39;var pp = this.getPrintParams();pp.interactive = pp.constants.interactionLevel.full;this.print(pp);&#39;, 200);&quot;;

//string jsTextNoWait = &quot;var pp = this.getPrintParams();pp.interactive = pp.constants.interactionLevel.full;this.print(pp);&quot;;

PdfAction js = PdfAction.JavaScript(jsText, writer);

writer.AddJavaScript(js);

document.Close()
</code></pre><p>As for the JavaScript, the call to setTimeOut is there so that the <span class="caps">PDF</span> is rendered before the print dialog is shown.  Otherwise, the users will see the print dialog and a blank page, which may be confusing.  If the PDF is not visible anyway (as in my case) then you don’t really need the timeout.  The actual printing is based on the documentation of Acrobat JavaScript from <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/acrobat_sdk/9.1/Acrobat9_1_HTMLHelp/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm?href=JS_API_AcroJSPreface.87.6.html&amp;accessible=true">Adobe’s website</a>.  In this example, the <a href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/acrobat_sdk/9.1/Acrobat9_1_HTMLHelp/wwhelp/wwhimpl/js/html/wwhelp.htm?href=JS_API_AcroJSPreface.87.6.html&amp;accessible=true">iteration level</a> is set to “full”, meaning that the user will get the print dialog and progress feedback.  You can also use “automatic” (no dialog, includes progress) and “silent” (no dialog or&nbsp;progress).</p>
<p><em><strong>Update 3/6/2015</strong></em>:</p>
<p>Because iTextSharp moved to the <span class="caps">AGPL</span>, we migrated the code over to use <a href="https://www.nuget.org/packages/PdfSharp">PdfSharp</a>.</p>
<p>The JavaScript function text is the&nbsp;same:</p>
<pre><code>const string jsText = &quot;var res = app.setTimeOut(&#39;var pp = this.getPrintParams();pp.interactive = pp.constants.interactionLevel.full;this.print(pp);&#39;, 200);&quot;;
</code></pre><p>And here is how it can be added to a PdfSharp <code>PdfDocument</code> object:</p>
<pre><code>PdfDictionary dict = new PdfDictionary(document);

// According to the PDF Reference the dictionary requires two elements.
// A key /S that specifies the action name, and a key /JS that set the JavaScript to run.
dict.Elements[&quot;/S&quot;] = new PdfName(&quot;/JavaScript&quot;);
dict.Elements[&quot;/JS&quot;] = new PdfName(&quot;/&quot; + jsText);

document.Internals.AddObject(dict);

document.Internals.Catalog.Elements[&quot;/OpenAction&quot;] = PdfInternals.GetReference(dict);
</code></pre><p>At this point you can save your document to a stream or&nbsp;file.</p>
