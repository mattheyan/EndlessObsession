          <h2>Getting Things Done:  Smart Lists</h2>
        </header>
        <section><h3 id="smart-lists">Smart&nbsp;Lists</h3>
<p>In <a href="http://endlessobsession.com/2010/07/21/getting-things-done/">my first gtd post</a>, I described some of the strategies that I employ to help me get things done.  <a href="http://rememberthemilk.com">Remember the Milk</a> has become a increasingly large part of that.  If you’re reading this and you don’t know about it, you should check it&nbsp;out!</p>
<p>Anyway, one thing that I discovered recently that has changed the way I use <span class="caps">RTM</span> is <a href="http://www.rememberthemilk.com/help/answers/smartlists/">smart lists</a>.  Seriously, I’m kicking myself for not knowing about this already!  Basically, smart lists are a way to save a search for later use, or, for the techies, a stored&nbsp;query.</p>
<p>This may not seem like a big deal, but for me it is <span class="caps">HUGE</span>.  This means that I can organize my tasks logically without having to worry about the different views that I might want to&nbsp;simulate.</p>
<p>To give you an idea of how this helps, here is my list of current smart lists (subject to change…a&nbsp;lot):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Big Projects</em></strong>:  Things that are going to take a long time.  These don’t normally show up on my day-to-day activity.  It allows me to get an idea of high-level things that I’m working towards.  There also shouldn’t be a lot of this due at the same&nbsp;time.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Blog</em></strong>:  Uses a “blog” tag so that I can track blogging stuff in separate logical lists (work, personal,&nbsp;etc…)</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Important</em></strong>:  Priority 1 tasks from all lists.  This list should stay pretty&nbsp;sparse.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>No Due</em></strong>:  Items that have not been assigned a due date are probably tentative or I may need to get rid of&nbsp;them.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>No Estimate</em></strong>:  Since some of my lists take time estimates in to account, it pays for me to move tasks out of this&nbsp;list.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>No Priority</em></strong>:  Much like no due, these tasks may need to be cleaned&nbsp;up.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Quick and Easy</em></strong>:  Time estimate is low.  This is ordered by due date, so I can use it to pick up easy tasks when I have a little time to&nbsp;spare.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>This Week</em></strong>:  Everything that is due this week, except for&nbsp;today.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Today</em></strong>:  Self&nbsp;explanatory</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>Work Day</em></strong>:  This is the same as “Today”, except filtered by an “am” tag that I use to indicate things that should be or can be done during the work day.  Walking the dog is not one of these, if I had a dog that&nbsp;is…</li>
</ul>
<p>I have now switched to using the “Work Day” list only for “I Forgot the Milk” on my work computer.  This way, I don’t have to mentally filter out tasks that I can’t do until I get&nbsp;home.</p>
<p>I have yet to realize the full potential of smart lists, but I know that they will make things run a lot smoother for&nbsp;me.</p>
