The topic of comments in code is by no means uncharted territory. It’s been
covered many times before (though perhaps not often enough). Just do a few
Google searches and you’ll find lots of good information on the topic.

Yet, somehow we keep writing bad comments. What gives?

I am not under the illusion that I can add anything novel or ground-breaking to
the discussion. What I will do is re-state the wisdom of others in my own way in
hopes that it adds just a little bit to the collective weight of those words.

    <id>http://endlessobsession.com/blog/so-long-octopress-hello-wintersmith</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[Octopress [http://octopress.org/] has been a popular hacker’s blog for quite a while, and so I made the switch a
few years ago in order to escape the clutches of Wordpress. Now I have a
hack-able blog that also costs me nothing to host.

Unfortunately, Octopress isn’t a good long-term fit. At the end of the day the
deal-breaker for me is the fact that it runs on ruby.

Don’t get me wrong, ruby itself is just fine. But, if you’ve worked with ruby on
Windows you know that its full of pain all the way down. If you’re thinking
about it, do yourself a favor and just don’t do it.

Sure, I could have run Linux on a separate partition, or on a VM, or in the
cloud, etc. I have no problem doing that, except that it requires managing yet
another machine/OS. I’m already investing enough time automating Windows-based
workstations, so why waste spend my time on it if I don’t have to?

So I set out to find an alternative that would work reliably on Windows, and run on node.js . I targeted node because it generally just works on Windows, and node and JavaScript in general are skills that I’m more
interested in developing. What I found was Wintersmith [https://github.com/jnordberg/wintersmith] .

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[This evening I noticed a syntax error in my blog's ATOM feed. The error seemed to stem from the text in one of my more recent posts, what exactly I didn't bother to determine. However, I also noticed that the post summaries were rather large and didn't appear to do a good job of summarizing post content in any case. So, it seemed the best thing to do was to figure out how I could get Octopress to use a better summary and kill 2 birds with one stone.]]>
