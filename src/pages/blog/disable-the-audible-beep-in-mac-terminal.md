This was starting to get on my nerves.  I really don't need a fancy sound clip to keep reminding me that I deleted as far as I can go.  I always do that, since I'm a bit OCD.  This one took me too long to find, mainly becuase of tabs.

Anyway, to disable the sounds, go to **_Terminal -> Preferences -> Settings (top tab group) -> Advanced (inner tab group)_**, look for the "Bell" group label and uncheck the "Audible Bell" option.  Note that this is specific to a particular settings configuration/theme, so if you switch themes the behavior will change.
