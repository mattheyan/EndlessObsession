  <div class="entry-content"><p>I ran across this provacative post on the tubes: <a href="http://jhovgaard.net/how-i-stopped-writing-awesome-code">How I stopped writing awesome code</a>. The following is my reaction and thoughts (hastily thrown together). Go to the link and read it first or what follows probably won&#8217;t make much sense.</p>

<p>I certainly agree that some of the practices he mention can have little benefit in the short term. Many people pointed out in the comments that the short term gains of &#8220;trimming the fat&#8221; can come back to haunt you on long term projects, and I&#8217;ll second that.</p>

<p>Someone in the comments described how they have frequently inherited projects where it looked like the developer(s) had this mindset and it usually turned out to be a mess/headache to maintain. I think the mental burden he described to understand concepts/tools like IOC, ORMs, etc. is only one side of the coin. The other side is that not following best practices and using powerful tools that are available can be just as frustrating to a developer who inherits the project (or even your future self), especially in the event that the app has to be significantly enhanced or changed. That said, I have also had the experience where I found that I had over-engineered a project too early and ended up &#8220;stuck&#8221; with some of those poor decisions later on. I think the key is to not try to over-engineer too early, but rather follow only tried and true best practices that require little added effort and could yield future gains, improve and refactor as the project grows, and never be satisfied with where things are today. For what it&#8217;s worth, in the case where I made regrettable engineering decisions early on, I was also deviating from common/best practices, i.e. trying to be clever.</p>

<p>As for F12, I don&#8217;t think you can ever really get around the limitations of the IDE with respect to interfaces and abstract/virtual members. I have been in the habit lately of using Shift+F12 (symbol search) rather than &#8220;Go to Definition&#8221; unless I know for sure that there is a single implementation of the member that I&#8217;m trying to get at. Resharper is also a good choice to improve the IDE experience. As irritating as F12 can be, I wouldn&#8217;t use that as reason to avoid using useful language features.</p>

<p>Finally, to tie it together with an anecdote: I can think of two projects off the top of my head that seem to fall into the too extremes. One was hastily thrown together by a freelance developer to meet a client need. The source control wasn&#8217;t hosted on a popular OSS hosting services, it was just offered up for download on the blog.  There were no unit tests.  Most of the code was in a single class file with a number of supporting classes that were essentially just data containers.  On the one hand, I ended up having to significantly enhance that project and found it to be very frustrating and painful.  On the other hand, if he hadn&#8217;t thrown it together it may be that nothing like it would have existed at all and I would have been forced to start from square 1 (and making my own mistakes as a result).  The other project was a highly engineered and conformed to a highly detailed open specification, complete with interfaces, IOC, and unit tests galore.  On the one hand, when I discovered a bug I was able to easily verify the bug via unit test, fix it, and see it go green.  On the other hand, the project is not very active now (has been somewhat superseded by other technology) so you could argue that the effort was wasted.</p>

<p>Its all about balance&#8230;</p>

<p>Also, someone pointed out that its possible to write tests as UI acceptance tests that actually interact with the web browser (using Selenium) and mimic user behavior. I happen to use WatiN instead in my day-to-day, but what&#8217;s important is that you can verify the behavior that your clients are going to be looking for in an automated fashion. Do it!</p>

<p>Thanks to Jonas for provoking critical thought!  :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Recently I co-presented with <a href="http://bobbydimmick.com/">Bobby Dimmick</a> at the annual <a href="http://codecamp.developersguil1d.org/">Carolina Code Camp</a>, put on by the Enterprise Developers Guild of Charlotte.  The event was wildly successful, with sold-out attendance and a day fully booked with speakers.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/arturask/sets/72157629645140924/with/7162456222/">Pictures from the event</a></p>

<p>Our presentation was entitled &#8220;Building rich, model-centric, event-driven web apps using EF, Razor &amp; open source&#8221;.  The approach we took was to build a demo application from the ground up, and document the process so that it was reproducible.  The app is hosted at <a href="http://todoapp.exosuite.com">todoapp.exosuite.com</a> and the walkthrough is at <a href="http://todoapp.exosuite.com/walkthrough">todoapp.exosuite.com/walkthrough</a>.</p>

<p><img src="../images/todoapp.png" alt="Screenshot" /></p>

<p>You can build the app yourself by following the walkthrough.  I promise, I did it many times!  :)</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="http://endlessobsession.com/2011/08/21/learning-fsharp-with-tdd-part-1/">Last time</a> I talked about setting up F# testing using NUnit, TestDriven.Net, and NaturalSpec. Â This time around I&#8217;ll elaborate a little bit on the testing aspects, and also talk about active patterns.</p>

<h2>Running tests</h2>

<p>First, I noticed a little problem with running the tests. Â If I right-clicked on a test method and selected &#8220;Run Test(s)&#8221;, then the test would run as expected. Â However, if I selected &#8220;Run Test(s)&#8221; for a project or solution, the tests would not be found as described in the <a href="http://www.navision-blog.de/2009/11/08/getting-started-with-naturalspec/">getting started post</a>, so I would see something like &#8220;0 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, &#8230;&#8221;.</p>

<p>The solution for me was to transition from using local spec methods to defining a &#8220;Tests&#8221; class, with the &#8220;TestFixtureAttribute&#8221;, and define my specs as static methods (they could be instance methods if needed of course).</p>

<pre><code>[&lt;TestFixture&gt;]
typeÂ TestsÂ =Â class
    new()Â =Â {}

    [&lt;Scenario&gt;]
    staticÂ memberÂ When_... () =
        // test body

end
</code></pre>

<p>Voila, tests run as expected!</p>

<p>Now, a little explanation of how you write the specs&#8230;</p>

<h2>Writing specs</h2>

<p>From Â <a href="http://www.navision-blog.de/2009/02/23/introducing-naturalspec-a-dsl-for-testing-part-i/">Introducing NaturalSpec â€“ A Domain-specific language (DSL) for testing â€“ Part I</a></p>

<blockquote><p>With the Keyword â€œ<strong>Given</strong>â€ I can create a test context (the objects I want to test). In this sample I created a list with 5 elements. With the keyword â€œ<strong>When</strong>â€ I call a function which does something with my test context. In this case I want to remove the value 3. In the Assert section (keywords â€œ<strong>It should</strong>â€ or â€œ<strong>It shouldnâ€™t</strong>â€) I can give some observations, which should hold for my manipulated test context.</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li><p>Create the object(s) to be tested using &#8220;Given&#8221;</p></li>
<li><p>Pipe into &#8220;When&#8221; to call functions (or do other things)</p></li>
<li><p>Pipe into &#8220;It should/shouldn&#8217;t&#8221; to set up assertions</p></li>
<li><p>Finally, pipe into the &#8220;Verify&#8221; method to run the tests and print the output</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Here&#8217;s an example:</p>

<pre><code>[&lt;TestFixture&gt;]
type Tests = class
    new() = {}

    [&lt;Scenario&gt;]
    static member When_getting_the_state_of_a_new_connection_it_should_be_closed () =
        Given NewConnection()
            |&gt; When getting DbConnection.State
            |&gt; It should equal "Closed"
            |&gt; Verify

end
</code></pre>

<p>The NewConnection() method call is entirely fabricated. It serves as the test context in the example.</p>

<p>&#8220;When getting&#8221; is followed by a method that takes as input the test context object type (presumably a connection object) and returns some value (string).</p>

<p>The &#8220;equal&#8221; method, based on the previous information, takes in two strings and asserts that they are equals.</p>

<p>And here&#8217;s the output:</p>

<blockquote><p>Scenario: When getting the state of a new connection it should be closed</p>

<p>Â  - Given &lt;fun:When_getting_the_state_of_a_new_connection_it_should_be_closed&#8230;</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â - When gettingÂ</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â  => It should equal &#8220;Closed&#8221;</p>

<p>Â  ==> Result is: &#8220;Closed&#8221;</p>

<p>Â  ==> OK</p>

<p>Â  ==> Time: 0.2060s</p>

<p>1 passed, 0 failed, 0 skipped, took 0.61 seconds (NUnit 2.5.10).</p></blockquote>

<p>There&#8217;s room for improvement, but it&#8217;s good enough for now, so on to active patterns!</p>

<h2>Active Patterns</h2>

<p>From <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd233248.aspx">MSDN</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Active patternsÂ enable you to define named partitions that subdivide input data, so that you can use these names in a pattern matching expression just as you would for a discriminated union. You can use active patterns to decompose data in a customized manner for each partition.</p></blockquote>

<p>One example they give is even and odd. Â You can define a pattern for &#8220;Even&#8221; or &#8220;Odd&#8221; and use that in pattern matching like so:</p>

<pre><code>match input with
    | Even -&gt; // do something if even...
    | Odd -&gt; // do something if odd...
</code></pre>

<p>Compare that with:</p>

<pre><code>if (input % 2 === 0) {
    // do something if even...
}
else {
    // do something if odd...
}
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, you could do something like this:</p>

<pre><code>if (isEven(input)) {
</code></pre>

<p>&#8230;but that still doesn&#8217;t read quite as well in my opinion.</p>

<p>Even more interesting, you can define partial active patterns that might match the given input, and if so, can transform the result in some way. Â The example they gave was number parsing.</p>

<pre><code>let (|Integer|_|) (str: string) =
    let mutable i = 0
    if System.Int32.TryParse(str, &amp;i) then Some(i)
    else None

let (|Float|_|) (str: string) =
    let mutable f = 0.0
    if System.Double.TryParse(str, &amp;f) then Some(f)
    else None

// Consuming code somewhere...
match str with
    | Integer i -&gt; printfn "%d : Integer" i
    | Float f -&gt; printfn "%f : Floating point" f
    | _ -&gt; printfn "%s : Not matched." str
</code></pre>

<p>This illustrates what makes pattern matching different from traditional control structures. It&#8217;s actually a <strong><em>reusable</em></strong> control structure plus potential augmentation of the input.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s a post where someone who really digs pattern matching <a href="http://lorgonblog.wordpress.com/2008/04/17/an-example-of-the-interplay-between-language-features-and-library-design-part-two/">attempts to explain why</a>, if you&#8217;re interested.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I recently <a href="http://groups.google.com/group/exosuite/browse_thread/thread/83ed447767348b75">posted a message</a> to the ExoSuite Google Group in regards to type loading in ExoWeb.</p>

<h2>Batch loading</h2>

<p>Types are now batch loaded. This means that prior to type caching your pages should only send a single type request (or very few depending on your usage). This was implemented to cut down on the large number of requests sent from the browser, since browsers have limits on the number of concurrent request.</p>

<p>You donâ€™t have to do anything to enable this functionality.</p>

<h2>Type loading and rules</h2>

<p>We noticed that a surprisingly large number of types were being requested, and some of them didnâ€™t seem like types that should be needed. I was able to track this down to the â€œAllowedValuesâ€ rule, which was force loading types when instantiated. Since this rule is very common, and often spans types, this would result in a cascading type loading effect. I changed the ruleâ€™s active type loading behavior to a passive approach: it becomes enabled when the relevant types are loaded.</p>

<p>There are two possible side-effects of this change that come to mind.</p>

<p>First, if you happen to have an allowed values property on a type that is neither the containing type of the property or the property type, then the rule may never be enabled, even if the data is all loaded and editable. This is an odd scenario that shouldnâ€™t happen in practice. To illustrate, if type Person has a property Org of type Organization, and its allowed values are World.AllOrganizations, and type World is not used, then the rule will never be activated. The only way that this example makes sense is if the type World is a required type for the entire app (or feature area), and so will always be available.</p>

<p>Second, if you are not actually referencing a type in your query paths but subsequently used that type in templates/scripts or expected a $extend to fire when the type was loaded, then in the past you may gotten away with this because of the overly aggressive nature of type loading. Now, types are only loaded because they are referenced in your queries or are otherwise required for object loading (i.e. due to lazy loading). One caveat: several other rules (e.g. CompareRule) may still force type loading to occur. They are less likely to actually change the nature of type loading, but still this behavior may also be changed in the future for other rules.</p>

<p>The moral of the story: donâ€™t depend on rules to perform type loading.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I decided to dive into a few languages I&#8217;ve been meaning to learn by way of the <a href="http://osherove.com/tdd-kata-1/">calculator kata</a>. Â First up: F#.</p>

<p>First, some prerequisites.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>F#, obviously. Â This comes with VS 2010 so you probably already have it.</p></li>
<li><p>We&#8217;re doing TDD, so we need some sort of testing framework. Â I decided to go with <a href="http://www.navision-blog.de/2009/11/08/getting-started-with-naturalspec/">NaturalSpec</a>. Â This means we&#8217;ll need to download the package from <a href="https://github.com/forki/NaturalSpec">github</a>, build it, and also download and install <a href="http://www.nunit.org/index.php?p=download">NUnit</a> and <a href="http://testdriven.net/default.aspx">TestDriven.NET</a>. Â The author has a good <a href="http://www.navision-blog.de/2009/11/08/getting-started-with-naturalspec/">blog post</a> on setting up and running the test project.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Keep in mind that I&#8217;m extremely new to the language, so the code I ended up with probably doesn&#8217;t reflect what a seasoned F# programmer would write. Â I tried to follow conventions that I could pick out as much as possible. Â The first part of the kata is an add function. Â Pretty simple. Â In the interest of not getting bogged down in one language I didn&#8217;t take if very far, so I will only be able to make very broad observations at this point.</p>

<p>Two positive things that I took away from it: Â pattern matching and pipe.</p>

<p>Pattern matching is something that I knew was popular in functional programming circle but had never experienced first hand. Â Now that I have a taste of it I think it&#8217;s a handy abstraction, but I have a feeling that I haven&#8217;t even begun to scratch the surface of what it could mean.</p>

<pre><code>let addNumbers (numbers : List) =
    match numbers.Length with
    | 0 -&gt; 0
    | 1 -&gt; numbers.[0]
    | _ -&gt; numbers |&gt; Seq.reduce (fun a b -&gt; a + b)
</code></pre>

<p>This is simply an alternative form of the familiar if-else branching logic, nothing special really, but it is pleasantly terse.</p>

<p>Pipe is even more exciting. Â Take the following for example.</p>

<pre><code>numbers.Split ',' |&gt; Array.toList |&gt; List.map int |&gt; addNumbers
</code></pre>

<p>Using the pipe operator (that&#8217;s &#8220;|>&#8221;) you can stream a value through a series of transformations, in this case splitting the string, converting the array to a list, converting the items in the list to integers, and finally passing the list to a method called &#8220;addNumbers&#8221;.</p>

<p>In any other language this would probably read similarly if your transformations are all instance methods, however, that breaks down as soon as you have to use global or static/class methods. Â The pipe form always reads nicely from the beginning to the end. Â Of course, this example could be a little simpler since our function can technically accept an array as its argument.</p>

<p>To be continued&#8230;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This was starting to get on my nerves. Â I really don&#8217;t need a fancy sound clip to keep reminding me that I deleted as far as I can go. Â I always do that, since I&#8217;m a bit OCD. Â This one took me too long to find, mainly becuase of tabs.</p>

<p>Anyway, to disable the sounds, go to <strong><em>Terminal -> Preferences -> Settings (top tab group) -> Advanced (inner tab group)</em></strong>, look for the &#8220;Bell&#8221; group label and uncheck the &#8220;Audible Bell&#8221; option. Â Note that this is specific to a particular settings configuration/theme, so if you switch themes the behavior will change.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Using the tf command line tool you can rollback all or part of a tfs checkin. Â This is useful for two reasons: 1) If you at least want to roll back all changes in one or more file (not some changes in a file) then it saves you from having to manually revert changes (I&#8217;m a firm believer in not giving yourself the opportunity to goof up) , and 2) the checkin is actually marked as a <em>rollback</em>, so you don&#8217;t have to rely on checkin notes to identify it as such.</p>

<p>As a side note, based on what I&#8217;ve seen in the way that tfs represents changes, this rollback changeset is simply an add, edit or delete, with the additional information that it was a rollback of a prior change. Â The original checkin is still in the tfs history.</p>

<p>To do a rollback, first open up the visual studio command prompt. Â You should have a shortcut in your start menu. Â On my machine the command is: <em><strong>%comspec% /k &#8220;&#8221;c:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 10.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat&#8221;&#8221; x86</strong></em>.</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  [/lock:none|checkin|checkout] [/version:versionspec]</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  [/keepmergehistory] [/noprompt] [/login:username,[password]]</p>

<p>tf rollback /toversion:versionspec itemspec [/recursive]</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  [/lock:none|checkin|checkout] [/version:versionspec]</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  [/keepmergehistory] [/noprompt] [/login:username,[password]]</p>

<p>Versionspec:</p>

<p>Â  Â  Date/Time Â  Â  Â  Â  D&#8221;any .Net Framework-supported format&#8221;</p>

<p>Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  or any of the date formats of the local machine</p>

<p>Â  Â  Changeset number Â Cnnnnnn</p>

<p>Â  Â  Label Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Â  Llabelname</p>

<p>Â  Â  Latest version Â  Â T</p>

<p>Â  Â  Workspace Â  Â  Â  Â  Wworkspacename;workspaceowner</p>

<p>First, we need to make sure we are working within our workspace.</p>

<p><strong><em>cd path\to\workspace\root</em></strong></p>

<p>So, for example, we could rollback an entire changeset:</p>

<p><strong><em>tf rollback /changeset:12345</em></strong></p>

<p>Or, we can rollback a single item in the changeset:</p>

<p><strong><em>tf rollback /changeset:12345 $/Path/To/Item</em></strong></p>

<p>There is also a login param that you can pass if needed:</p>

<p><strong><em>tf rollback /changeset:12345 /login:domain\username,password</em></strong></p>

<p>Enjoy!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Hereâ€™s a neat visual studio tip.  You can run any external command from within visual studio, and add a button to the command bar or map it to a keyboard shortcut.  This is really important to me because I rely heavily on keyboard shortcuts.  I love that I can hit a combination of keys and perform a repetitive task automatically, plus the result can be incorporated into visual studio by way of the output window.</p>

<p>Some examples of what you might use this for:</p>

<ul>
<li>Get latest on several team projects to start your day.</li>
<li>Check out a specific set of files.</li>
<li>Automate various git commands from within visual studio.</li>
<li>Run a batch file with a set of arguments that you define when you run it.</li>
<li>Launch another application (i.e.: web browser).</li>
</ul>


<p>What follows is inspired by Rob Conery&#8217;s Git series on tekpub.  You&#8217;ll have to watch the full video to see how he uses external tools to incorporate git in Visual Studio.</p>

<hr />

<p>To get started from the menu go to Tools -> External Tools.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattheyan/5384927410/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5216/5384927410_e1d55e1e57.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Then you should see a dialog that looks like this:</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattheyan/5384323203/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5215/5384323203_efb55aba83.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>Some of the options are pretty self-explanatory.</p>

<ul>
<li>Title is obvious.</li>
<li>Command is the path to the command to execute, also obvious.</li>
<li>Arguments is pretty simple on the surface, but we have some interesting options at our disposal, which you can use to make the command contextual.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattheyan/5384366343/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5216/5384366343_e368894d46.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<ul>
<li>We have similar options for the initial directory.</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattheyan/5384366357/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5217/5384366357_d33e12f2fa.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>In this example I&#8217;m using the file name and extension of the current item (open document) to run using node, assuming it&#8217;s a JavaScript file.  I selected &#8220;Use Output window&#8221; so that the output will show up in visual studio, rather than launching a separate window.  This is handy if you don&#8217;t need to perform any additional tasks after the fact.</p>

<p>So, now that you have your external command, you can run it from the &#8220;Tools&#8221; menu.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/mattheyan/5385120864/"><img src="http://farm6.static.flickr.com/5217/5385120864_b21ca90a5b.jpg" alt="" /></a></p>

<p>You can also add buttons to the toolbar, map keyboard shortcuts (search for &#8220;ExternalCommand1, &#8220;ExternalCommand2&#8221;, etc.), and maybe even add context menu items (though I haven&#8217;t figured that one out completely).</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>As a follow up to myÂ <a href="www.google.com">Brief Introduction to ExoWeb</a>, I would like to go into more detail about the communications between client and server.</p>

<p>The client interacts with the server in two basic ways.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Pulling information: type and instance data.</p></li>
<li><p>Pushing information: changes to the model and/or instructions to do something.</p></li>
</ol>


<p>The first type, pulling information, is pretty straightforward. Type information doesnâ€™t change (frequently) so it is actually cached on the client if possible. Querying for instance data is similar to querying a database. You request an object of a particular type with a particular id, but you can also include a set of paths that tell the services what additional related data you are interested in. The primary component of a query might look something like this.</p>

<pre><code>{ from: "Person", id: "1", and: ["this.Additional.Properties.To.Load"] }
</code></pre>

<p>The second type, pushing information, gets a little more interesting. If youâ€™re going to sync data between two disconnected systems there are two primary approaches that you might take. First, you could send simple data from point A to point B, manipulate it, then send it back from point B to point A in the same form. As you could imagine this can get pretty expensive and tedious. Of course, you might just send the portions of data that have changed to cut down on overhead. The bigger problem, I think, is that you donâ€™t really know what has happened unless you do full graph comparisons. Another approach is to keep track of <em>changes</em> as they occur and send those back and forth. This is what ExoWeb does.</p>

<pre><code>changes: [ { type: "ValueChange", instance: { id: "1", type: "Person" }, property: "FirstName", oldValue: "Rob", newValue: "Robert" }, ... } ]
</code></pre>

<p>The client can also raise events, for example â€œsaveâ€, a built-in event. In response, the server can send back additional changes to the model.</p>

<pre><code>changes: [ { type: "Save", idChanges: [ { type: "Person", from: "?4", to: "644" } ] }, ... ]
</code></pre>

<p>The payload isnâ€™t limited to data. It can also include conditions, for example, permissions, or invalid data conditions. More on that later.</p>

<p>This has been a very basic introduction to the way client-server communication works in ExoWeb. Look out for more updates in the future.</p>
