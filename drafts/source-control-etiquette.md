Source Control Etiquette
========================

According to it's [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revision_control),
source control is "essential for the organization of multi-developer projects".
I'm going to assume that you not only know what source control is, but also agree
wholeheartedly with that statement.
