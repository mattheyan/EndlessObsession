Source Control Etiquette
========================

I can't imagine working on a software project without source control. It's not
an optional tool - it's absoutely essential. But, as Lavar says, you don't have
to take my word for it:

[exhibit #2](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/52608/is-version-control-necessary-for-a-small-development-group-1-2-programmers),
[exhibit #3](https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/you-need-source-code-control-now/),
[exhibit #4](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1408450/why-should-i-use-version-control).

Assuming that you already agree with this sentiment, or have been convinced, the
next logical step is to consider **how** to use source control appropriately.

I think it's helpful to think of source control in terms of etiquette. There are
conventions that we _generally_ agree on, but not everyone agrees
all the time. Some things are clearly more important than others, and some
are simply a matter of preference. Like a culture or society that decides its
own customs, each team can decided on its own source control practices.

_BTW: The etiquette analogy is not something that I invented. A Google search
for "source control etiquette" turns up a few results._

That being said, ettiquette and customs are important.
