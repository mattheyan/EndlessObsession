Keyboard-Friendly UIs on the Web
================================

It's easy to ignore the keyboard when you're building web applications,
especially if it isn't important to you personally. You could be forgiven for
thinking that it doesn't matter, but hopefully I can convince you that it does.

If you're already convinced that being keyboard-friendly is important, then you
can [skip to the good stuff](#info).

Why Keyboard Matters
--------------------

There are at least two major categories of user's who would benefit from
keyboard-friendly UIs, and I'll throw in a third for good measure.

* People with disabilities, particularly those that affect their ability to see
  or to operate a mouse
* Power-users, or those who just prefer to use the keyboard
* BONUS: People using a tablet or laptop with a lousy trackpad

OK, so I threw in that last one for personal reasons. I don't know how many
other people experience this, but keyboard-friendly apps and websites are so
much easier to use when I'm on my surface or laptop and I don't have a USB mouse
handy.

For users with disabilities, whether or not a website or app is
keyboard-friendly could mean the difference between being able to use it, or
having to move on to something else. And, hopefully there *is* something else...

The ability to get things done with a keyboard is just one part of the bigger
concept of accessiblity (also know as "a11y" on Twitter and such). I won't
cover that topic in-depth here, but suffice it to say if you're not paying
attention to accessibility you're neglecting an under-served population. We can,
and should, do better so that everyone can experience the web to the fullest. 

A keyboard-friendly UI can also help power-users get things done more
efficiently. They'll love you for it, and it could mean the difference in
choosing your app over another.

Keyboard-Friendly Checklist
---------------------------

In my opinion, a keyboard-friendly app or site meets the following criteria:

* Able to "tab" through fields in a logical sequence
* It should be clear where tab focus is at any time
* Set and maintain focus appropriately
* Able to interact with all controls using only the keyboard
* Implements custom keyboard shortcuts to improve usability
