Git Dropbox
===========

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) and [git](https://git-scm.com/) are two of
the best tools available for file backup/syncing and source control, respectively.
While they're great tools on their own, I think when used together they form an
even more useful combo.

Before we get into that, if you haven't used either you really owe it to
yourself to check them out.

I've been using Dropbox for a while now, and I even found it so useful that I
decided to pony up for a paid account in order to get more storage space. I've
tried other syncing tools off and on but have always come back to Dropbox in the
end. Put simply: it just works.

Git seems to be most people's preferred source control system today, at least in
open source. The Linux kernal is in git. Most of the hip, new open source
projects are hosted on Github. Microsoft has embraced git by supporting it in
Visual Studio and even hosting some of their projects on Github.

One benefit of git as compared to some other source control systems is that the
entire repository can be stored in files on disc. You don't have to run a web
site on a server somewhere. This makes its pairing with Dropbox even more useful.
Oh, and it also helps that it seems to be really fast.
