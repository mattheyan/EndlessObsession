I am a software developer for VC3, Inc., an IT consulting company in Columbia, SC.  I work on a web-based software product called Enrich, which serves numerous school districts across the country.  I specialize in JavaScript and .NET web technologies, but also dabble in python, ruby, and F#.  In my free time I play guitar and enjoy outdoor activities as much as possible.
